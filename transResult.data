<summary>好难，看不懂</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>自认为C语言基础很好，结果根据评论买了C++primer打算学习。开始看着还可以，毕竟有C基础。后面就完全看不懂了，而且翻译在表达上很拗口，难理解。不知道是C++太难还是翻译有问题。所以很诚恳的建议初学C++的童鞋不要买这本书了，真的不适合入门。</text>

<summary_trans>So hard, don't understand</summary_trans><text_trans>I think that the C language foundation is very good, and I bought C++primer according to the comments and I plan to learn. It’s okay to start watching, after all, there is a C foundation. I can't understand it at the end, and the translation is very vocal and difficult to understand. I don't know if C++ is too difficult or there is a problem with translation. Therefore, I sincerely recommend not to buy this book for children who are new to C++. It is really not suitable for getting started.</text_trans></item>

<text>内容确实不错。但书的质量非常让人失望，纸张薄差不说，印刷也很模糊，与盗版书简直有的一比！书有明显折痕不说，里面居然还有一页是残缺的，像是被人撕过，简直是气人！在卓越网上买了很多次书了，这次绝对是最差的，本想退货，但嫌麻烦，还是自认倒霉算了，唉！</text>

But the quality of the book is very disappointing, the paper is not thin, the printing is also very vague, and it is almost the same as the pirated book! There are obvious creases in the book, and there is still a page in it that is incomplete, like being torn by people, it is simply mad! I bought a lot of books on the Internet. This time it is definitely the worst. I want to return it, but I am too troublesome, but I still think it is unfortunate. Oh!</text_trans></item>

<summary>极差的书</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>个人感觉这本书确实不怎么样，买来了之后就已经极度的后悔了。里面讲的东西确实不怎么样，或者就是没水平吧，建议买这本书的同志慎重。有点垃圾的书籍，并没有讲到多少有用的东西，也没有多少实例，那就更别提给你讲讲原理了。而且这本书里包含了一些作者写的其他书的引用，难道买这本书的时候还要把作者所有的书都买下来才能看不成吗？同志们慎重啊，不要像我一样买来了再后悔。Struts可不是一些简单的java啊，实例原理都是非常重要，必不可缺的，显然这本书都不具备。不知道作者出于什么目的写了这本书。for money吧。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Very poor book</summary_trans><text_trans>Personally, this book is really not very good. After I bought it, I have already regretted it. The things that are said inside are really not very good, or that there is no level. It is recommended that the comrades who bought this book be cautious. A little junk books, there are not many useful things, and there are not many examples, let alone tell you the principle. And this book contains references to other books written by the author. Is it necessary to buy all the books of the author when you buy this book to be incapable? Comrades are cautious, don't buy it like me and regret it. Struts is not a simple java, the example principle is very important, it is indispensable, obviously this book does not have. I don't know what the author wrote this book for. For money.</text_trans></item>

<text>买书的时候，就发现本网页的书摘插图中天鹅上面的几行字是歪的，不在一条直线上，当时以为是做网页时做歪了，没想到拿到书，字真的是歪的，竟然还把这一页作为书摘放在网页上！
最让人不舒服的是，书拿到后内第一页脏兮兮的，全是黑手印，我一气就把它和封面粘在一起了，眼不见为净，不过后悔的是，这下想换也换不了了！
最影响使用的是，页边距设置不合理，外边距太大，内边距太小，要使劲把中间的缝压开，才能看见中间的字。真的很想换，可是被我粘起来了，唉，冲动是魔鬼啊！</text>

<summary_trans>Is this book a genuine book?</summary_trans><text_trans>When I bought the book, I found that the lines on the swan in the abstract illustration of this page are awkward, not on a straight line. I thought it was a smash when I was doing the webpage. I didn’t expect to get the book. The word is really awkward. I even put this page on the page as a book digest!
The most uncomfortable thing is that after the book was taken, the first page was dirty, all black handprints. I stuck it to the cover with a sigh of relief, but I didn’t see it as a net, but regret it, this time I can't change it if I want to change it!
The most influential use is that the margin setting is unreasonable, the outer margin is too large, and the inner margin is too small. It is necessary to force the middle seam to be pressed to see the middle word. I really want to change, but I got stuck, oh, the impulse is the devil!</text_trans></item>

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>“XX决定XX”这种模式的书还少么？所谓的成功学、励志学、求职学，不过都是一丘之貉。类似的东西看看卡耐基就可以了。不会有人真以为看了几本这样的书，被里面编造的故事感动激励了一把，自己的现实生活就会真的有所改变吧！
  还是希望大家多培养自己的能力，别把时间荒废在《致加西亚的信》这样的东西上。多思考自己的当下，多培养和工作实际有关的能力才是最重要的。这种书在我看来没有多大意义，还不如看日本的热血漫画。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Please reflect on you.</summary_trans><text_trans>Is there a small book on the "XX decision XX" model? The so-called success studies, motivational studies, and job-seeking studies are all just a glimpse. Look at Carnegie for something similar. No one really thought that I had read a few books like this, and I was inspired by the story made up inside, and my real life would really change!
  I still hope that everyone will develop their own abilities and don’t let time lag in things like the letter to Garcia. It is most important to think more about your current situation and to develop more practical and relevant skills. This kind of book doesn't make much sense to me. It's better to watch Japan's blood comics.</text_trans></item>

<text>准备吴哥自由行，买了LP的柬埔寨，五月盛放，看了蒋勳的视频，研读了印度神话，海量阅读了网络的各类攻略游记及官方信息。综合比较后，极力推荐本书。
它不仅能提供主要景点的详细俯视图，标明了重要的看点，还做到了夹叙夹议，简单穿插历史背景和神话等内容。
当然，本书最有用的信息是能为自由行的人们提供完备的吃穿住行娱购等众多信息。即使语言不同，也能通过彩色照片点餐，各类名称还提供3种语言（中，英，柬）。
即使有少量差错的部分，此书任然体现了日本人的细腻与认真；同时表现了日本国作为强国的一面，那就是强国的国民有自信，有愿望，有能力以独立，客观，睿智，全面的眼光观察世界范围的历史地理和人文文化。
我抵制日货，但还是愿意学习这个民族的长处，衷心希望中国能自己编制一套自己的"走遍世界“，让国民成熟起来，成为真正的大国！</text>

<summary_trans>Great, recommended</summary_trans><text_trans>Prepare Angkor for free travel, buy LP in Cambodia, live in May, watch Jiang Xun's video, study Indian mythology, and read a lot of online travel notes and official information. After a comprehensive comparison, this book is highly recommended.
It not only provides a detailed top view of the main attractions, but also highlights the important points of view. It also makes a clip-on discussion, simply interspersed with historical backgrounds and myths.
Of course, the most useful information in this book is that it can provide a lot of information for people who are free to go shopping and shopping. Even if the language is different, you can order from color photos, and the names are also available in 3 languages ​​(Chinese, English, Cambodia).
Even with a small amount of mistakes, this book still reflects the exquisiteness and seriousness of the Japanese; at the same time, it shows the side of Japan as a powerful country, that is, the nationals of the powerful countries have confidence, desire, and ability to be independent, objective, and wise. A comprehensive vision of the world's historical geography and human culture.
I boycott Japanese goods, but I am still willing to learn the strengths of this nation. I sincerely hope that China can prepare its own "going around the world" and let the people mature and become a real big country!</text_trans></item>

<summary>价值观决定人生走向</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>我喜欢了解商界名人特别是那些知名企业家，了解他们成功的事业、深刻的言谈，以及有内涵的思想，读关于他们的书，看他们的博客和微博。潘石屹亦是我喜欢了解和关注的企业家之一。他的博客和微博我都在关注，但网络上的了解都比较碎片化，当有机会透过潘总的新书《我的价值观》来更全面地了解和学习潘总，非常欣喜。
这本书中，潘总阐述了他对房地产市场的认知、商业模式的开发、做人做事的原则、对理想和信仰的感悟、成长中影响价值观的因素、也谈了对一些人和事的思考。这些是潘总价值观的宏观描述，有一定的高度和广度。
而与张欣的爱情之路和矛盾冲突，父亲的生存哲学与父子深情，“万通六君子”的创业之路，全面而深入地谈及个人信仰这些方面，则是把潘总的价值观进行微观化剖析，具体到他的差异性巨大的婚姻，父亲和家庭对他的影响，创业之初时的事业奠基，宗教信仰对他的影响等等，这些都是用具体而显性的东西。
价值观是个很悬乎的东西，形而上，空而大；同时，它又非常具体真实地存在着，贯穿于一言一行，根植于精神世界。一个人的价值观决定了他的人生走向，价值观的不同决定了人生走向的不同。这是读潘总这本书带给我的感悟。
具体到我对价值观的理解，可以用我的用人理念来解释。今年我们公司在选拔人才方面，我把价值观作为考量因素之一纳入对应聘人员的甄选和考核标准中。和我们公司、公司管理层价值观比较接近的人，我们才会考虑聘用，否则，即使应聘者具备的能力与招聘岗位需求非常匹配，而他的价值观与企业和管理者的价值观差之千里，甚至完全相反，我们也不会聘用。之所以这样做，是因为我们认为具有相同或相似价值观的人，才有可能具备同样的工作态度，有比较一致的工作基准，对企业的未来发展有共同的愿景和努力。比如，我们不会聘用斤斤计较、唯利是图的人，因为与我们宽厚大度的人性品质相反；我们也不太会聘用懒惰消极、敷衍了事的人，因为与我们积极进取、精益求精的工作态度相违。
越来越深地体会到，工作上共事也好，生活上交友也好，越是年纪大，越是时间久，就越会趋向于和自己价值观接近的人共处、交往。至少对我来说如是。
价值观虽然看不见、摸不着，却是一个人的精神内核，一个人的价值观决定了他的人生走向。</text>

<summary_trans>Values ​​determine the direction of life</summary_trans><text_trans>I like to learn about business celebrities, especially those who are well-known entrepreneurs, to understand their successful careers, deep speech, and ideas, to read about their books, to see their blogs and Weibo. Pan Shiyi is also one of the entrepreneurs I like to know and pay attention to. I have been paying attention to his blog and Weibo, but the understanding on the Internet is fragmented. I am very pleased to have a chance to understand and learn more about Pan by Pan's new book, My Values.
In this book, Mr. Pan elaborated his understanding of the real estate market, the development of business models, the principles of doing things, the perception of ideals and beliefs, the factors that influence the values ​​of growth, and the discussion of some people and things. Thinking. These are macro descriptions of Pan's total values, with a certain degree and breadth.
And Zhang Xin’s love road and conflicts, the father’s philosophy of survival and the father and son’s deep feelings, the “Wantong Six Gentlemen” entrepreneurial road, comprehensive and in-depth talk about personal beliefs, is to carry out Pan’s values. The micro-analysis, specifically to his vastly different marriages, the influence of his father and family on him, the foundation of his career at the beginning of his career, the influence of religious beliefs on him, etc., are all concrete and explicit.
Values ​​are a very suspenseful thing, metaphysical, empty and large; at the same time, it exists in a very concrete and true way, rooted in words and deeds, rooted in the spiritual world. A person's values ​​determine his life direction, and the difference in values ​​determines the difference in life direction. This is the sentiment that Mr. Pan has brought to me.
Specific to my understanding of values, can be explained by my employment philosophy. This year, in the selection of talents for our company, I included the values ​​as one of the consideration factors in the selection and evaluation criteria of the corresponding recruits. We will consider hiring people who are close to our company and company management values. Otherwise, even if the candidate has the ability to match the job requirements, his values ​​are inferior to the values ​​of the company and the manager, even On the contrary, we will not hire. The reason for this is because we believe that people with the same or similar values ​​are likely to have the same work attitude, have a consistent work benchmark, and have a common vision and effort for the future development of the company. For example, we don't hire people who care about and profit, because they are contrary to our generous human nature; we also don't hire lazy, negative, perfunctory people because it is contrary to our aggressive and progressive work attitude. .
It is becoming more and more profound to understand that working together or making friends in life is the older, the longer it is, the more it will tend to coexist and interact with people whose values ​​are close. At least for me.
Although the values ​​are invisible and intangible, they are the spiritual core of a person. The values ​​of one person determine the direction of his life.</text_trans></item>

<text>在卓越买书也有几年了，觉得质量越来越差，上次买的《长短经》里面有的纸张都漏了，这次买的这本书，质量倒是没什么问题，可是正反面都磕坏了，一共买了七本，这本书是边上第二本，不是最外面的，结果都磕漏好多页，因为不是最外面的，所以不可能是运输途中出现的磕碰，封装之前也不看看就给顾客邮寄过来啊，还是特意把有问题的处理给我啊？</text>

<summary_trans>The book is damaged</summary_trans><text_trans>I have been buying books for a few years, and I feel that the quality is getting worse. The papers in the long and short scripts I bought last time are missing. The quality of this book bought this time is no problem, but both sides are bad. I bought a total of seven books. This book is the second one on the side, not the outermost one. The result is that many pages are missing. Because it is not the outermost one, it is impossible to be a bump in the transportation. If you look at it, mail it to the customer, or do you specifically give me the problem?</text_trans></item>

一直都在卓越买书，年后卓越的书价普遍大幅度上涨，这个不争的事实你们把我评论删了却无法掩饰这个事实！

The price of this book was 13.8 years ago, and then the price was reduced to around 9, and then the price rose straight after the year!
Up to the current 20! Although the book has reached its peak in sales after the year, you can't raise it so much!
I have always been buying books with excellence. After a year, the excellent book prices have generally risen sharply. This indisputable fact that you deleted my comments can not hide this fact!
Now that the price is so high, it is cheap and convenient to buy it online. You are so frustrated that the price is really disappointing to the loyal users!</text_trans></item>

抱着学习会计的心态买了这本书，一个下午就看完了，感觉不是很实用。
内容全部是微博上的小段子，供搞会计的人娱乐娱乐是挺不错，想要从中学习会计知识不太现实。
个人感觉，只有第一部分和第四部分还可以看看，学到点会计知识，其他章节基本是毫无用处，真心怀疑是不是凑页数的。
如果你想学习会计知识，建议不要买这本，不如小艾上班记实在；如果你想娱乐枯燥的会计生涯，建议直接去找马靖昊的微博，省钱又环保；当然，如果你想做点公益事业，可以考虑买这本书。</text>

I bought this book with the attitude of studying accounting. I finished reading it in one afternoon and it is not very practical.

Personally, only the first part and the fourth part can also look at it, learn some accounting knowledge, other chapters are basically useless, and really doubt whether it is a page number.
If you want to learn accounting knowledge, it is recommended not to buy this book, it is better to work in Xiao Ai; if you want to entertain the boring accounting career, it is recommended to go directly to Ma Jingwei's Weibo, save money and be environmentally friendly; of course, if you want If you want to do something about public welfare, you can consider buying this book.</text_trans></item>

知识点看着似乎很先进，很前卫，可是连基础都没讲清楚就讲这么新的技术和知识点，除非先看了一本讲计算机基础的书再看这本。

I have heard that everyone bought one and used it for two months to read it. It feels once and for all. This feeling is also strong once and for all. I feel this. The book is not based on the outline. As for the textbook, I don't comment, but I can responsibly say that this book is not suitable for postgraduate study. I don't know what everyone thinks.
The point of knowledge seems to be very advanced, very avant-garde, but even the basics are not clear to talk about such new technology and knowledge points, unless you first read a book on computer-based books and then look at this.

  当初看这本书的时候，感觉太过于浅显，太过于直白，没有华丽的语词，但是却还行，如今两书对比后不得不承认，语言类的书籍还是浅显些、直白些、平民些来的实用。

  When I first read this book, I felt too shallow, too straightforward, and there was no gorgeous words, but it was okay. Now I have to admit that after the comparison of the two books, the language books are still more obvious, straightforward, civilians. Some practical.

<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>《只剩一个角落的繁华》，文艺无比的书名，却不是一本矫情的小说。翻开第一篇，原来是在讲社会；翻开第二篇，原来是在讲经济；翻完最后一页，原来是让年轻人们在了解了世界的前提下，认真思考自己的人生。
　　你以为只有中国通货膨胀吗？不，欧洲更甚。你以为只有中国的大学生找不到工作吗？不，很多外国学生和我们做伴。你以为只有中国失业率高、房价高、小公司兴起又倒闭地周而往复吗？不，全世界都是这样。美国日益衰败的经济，欧债危机的严重性，这种种既定存在的事实，都在影响着中国的经济与社会，影响着我们中国为什么猪肉贵，为什么农民工被拖欠工资，为什么你的心总是慌乱不安。
　　那么，《只剩一个角落的繁华》让我们知道这么多令人绝望的事实，有何用处？也许它毫无帮助，但世界就是如此，我们有权知晓，我们必须知晓。中国学生在应试教育的体制下，脑子太好，知识太多，常识太少，眼界太窄。
　　而此书中，陈文茜的言辞恰好优美恳切，深入浅出，细数美国及欧洲的经济历史和现况种种，适合渴望走出框架，了解世界的文艺小青年儿们阅读。
　　或许，陈文茜的有些观点你并不认同，甚至我也认为她并不是很了解中国大陆的情形，但她关注世界、心系台湾和大陆年轻人的心，在《只剩一个角落的繁华》中，昭然若揭。文茜现年５４岁，未婚，无子。她在人民大学的校园演讲时说，“正因我没有孩子，所以全中国的孩子，都是我的孩子。”呵，口气大了些么？口气不大，从前也玩儿不了政治，现下，也写不出这样的书了。
　　若你想跳脱出现在生活的牢笼与苦闷，或是你生活还太过安逸而不知世界之苦，那么《只剩一个角落的繁华》，着实可以成为一本了解世界的窗，它会是你很好的了解世界经济的入门读物。
　　可当你了解了世界，世界却给不了你答案。脚下的路，终究是要自己来走。</text>

<summary_trans>This book presents the whole picture of the world, but the world cannot give you the answer.</summary_trans><text_trans>"There is only one corner of the bustling", the title of the art is incomparable, but it is not a novel. Turning on the first article, it was originally talking about society; turning the second one, it was talking about the economy; after finishing the last page, it was the young people who were thinking about the world and seriously thinking about their own lives.
Do you think that only China is inflation? No, Europe is even worse. Do you think that only Chinese college students can't find a job? No, many foreign students are with us. Do you think that only China’s high unemployment rate, high housing prices, small companies rise and fall again and again? No, the whole world is like this. The increasingly declining economy of the United States, the seriousness of the European debt crisis, and the existence of such established facts are affecting China’s economy and society, affecting why China’s pork is expensive, why migrant workers are being owed wages, and why your heart is always It is flustered.
Then, "There is only one corner of the bustling" let us know so many desperate facts, what is the use? Maybe it doesn't help, but the world is like this, we have the right to know, we must know. Under the system of exam-oriented education, Chinese students have a good brain, too much knowledge, too little common sense, and too narrow a vision.
In this book, Chen Wenzhao's words are just beautiful and succinct, deep and simple, detailed economic history and current situation in the United States and Europe, suitable for young people who are eager to get out of the framework and understand the world.
Perhaps, some of Chen Wenzhao’s views do not agree with me. I even think that she does not know much about the situation in mainland China. However, she is concerned about the world, the hearts of young people in Taiwan and the mainland, and in the "Prosperity of Only One Corner". It is clear that it is revealed. Wen Hao is 54 years old, unmarried and has no children. When she spoke at the campus of Renmin University, she said, "Because I don't have children, all the children in China are my children." Oh, is the tone bigger? The tone is not big. I have never played politics before. Now, I can't write such a book.
If you want to jump out of the cage and depression of life, or if your life is too comfortable and you don’t know the world, then "There is only one corner of the bustling", you can become a window to understand the world, it will be you A good introduction to the world economy's primers.
But when you understand the world, the world can't give you the answer. The road at the foot is, after all, to go by yourself.</text_trans></item>

<summary>哲学</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>一提“哲学”——感觉总是高高在上、云里雾里；
一谈“励志”呢——又觉得要么蛊惑人心，要么只言片语，还翻来覆去！
这中间还有个“人生哲学”，它似乎总悬在一个人现实生活的每时每刻，无时无刻——唉，它又是个什么东西？
认真读完这本《活法》，暂不论稻盛和夫“科学+佛教”的那套活法有没有道理，有多大的道理；它给予我的最大收获，是率真地向我展现了“哲学、人生与励志”——这三者他是如何相统一的认知轨迹。而更启发我的，则是每个人的一生，如果临到终了非要落于纸上，最好也得有我自己的、类似此类的东西。（否则，人活一世，“我”又算是一个什么样的东西呢？）
本书“前言”里，稻盛和夫列出了他的认知统一：
人生·工作的结果=人生信念×热情的态度×天资的能力；
我对其的理解是：西天取经=唐僧×沙和尚×孙悟空。
他怎么就单单落下了一个猪八戒？哪怕不是“乘以”，仅是“加上”那个可以嘻哈生活的猪八戒呢？时下的我们不是正大卖特卖，灿之又灿直到滥的那个猪八戒吗？
罗素在《幸福之路》里，不是说“幸福”，除了工作，还要培养自己的一些兴致，哪怕嗜好吗？
——傅佩荣在《哲学与人生》一书里说，每个历史时代都有各自的“形而上学”，它们都没有对错之分，只存在着“说理”上的精当与高下。由此，我明白了——在爱智与励志之间，必定有个专属我们每个人自己的人生信念。
稻盛和夫笃定着他那般“正剑”的人生哲学，——那我的呢？你的呢？</text>

如果作者要写小说就好好写小说，别打着旅行的幌子好么？

而作者所谓的旅行，不过是去热门景点看看奢侈的消费地点晃晃。
完全看不出来他在那个地方旅行看到了哪些独属于自己见解的风景和想法。
如果把它当一本旅行的书来读，真的挺对不起旅行这两个字的。

If the author wants to write a novel, just write a novel, don't you travel the scorpion?
Set of other people's comments: Big Brother, you are a business trip, not a trip.
Throughout the book are mixed with the emotions and misses of his girlfriend "Su"
I don't hate this. What is tangled is that it should be said that the so-called "travel" is mixed in the emotional description of "Su".
The so-called travel of the author is just to go to the hot spots to see the luxury of the consumption place.
I can't see the scenery and ideas that he saw in his place and saw his own opinions.
If you read it as a book for travel, I am really sorry for the word travel.
Well, if someone wants to follow the author for a spiritual journey, I want to know where the places he has been are attractive.
I want to find a reference for the way I travel, or I want to find the resonance of the so-called travel in the author's description.

<summary>有些成长，还是要交付时间</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>柴静的身上，有着大多数成功女性成长历程的一些特质。从吟风弄月到理性可观，从“每到春来，惆怅怀依旧”但往事无关痛痒，从矫情到真挚。
　　
　　 网上对于多年前她的另一本散文集《夜色温柔》评价很低，认为太过文艺范儿，无外乎青春、荒芜、迷茫、伤感。两相对比之下，《看见》以绝尘之姿赢得好评一片。
　　
　　 一边看书时，一边会抄下那些触动我心弦的句子，但在标注时才发现，更多打动我的部分都不是柴静说的。真正让这本书悄然在你神经上骚动一下的，是她的师长、同事、亲朋，是这些人理解、关注以及陪伴的，柴静的成长。
 　　
　　 我们常常会用一种套板效应去看待一个人一生的历程，“这个人是什么什么样的，所以你看他（她）怎样怎样。”其实，细细想来，人而为人，不是以一种姿态走完一生的历程，而是在一个历程中一步一步的被塑造，最终自我完满。像潺潺流动的水，经历了山川的阻挡，遭受了沙石的砥砺，被风轻抚，被雨恩泽，然后跟着它所历经的一切，蜿蜒成了最终的模样。柴静是这样，我们也是这样。
 　　
　　 爱读书、善思考者，大多都是反社会的。他们往往以一种凌驾、孤绝的姿态，先于岁月而成长。于是，大多数的人都会犯一个错误，带着一双少年老成的眼光去看待我们所处的世界，用自以为卓越的方式规划自我的生活。
 　　
　　 就像柴静会遭遇瓶颈一样，这样的我们终会有一天，赫然醒悟，世界不是我以为的那样，也许我本来应该是怎生模样。很多道理，你耳熟能详，但痛彻肺腑的理解终于还是要亲身经验。
 　　
　　 看了《看见》，最深的感触就在于此。那些学识，那些我们引以为豪的精神财富，在没有遭遇现实，未曾经验之时，我们的头脑仅仅只是它们的跑马场。
　　
　　 我们有很多需要理解的事，我们需要很久很久的时间才得以成长，否则，要这么漫长的人生做什么？

<summary_trans>Some growth, or delivery time</summary_trans><text_trans>Chai Jing’s body has some qualities of most successful women’s growth. From the hurricane to the moon to the rational, from the "every spring, the old is still" but the past is irrelevant, from the feelings to the true.

On the Internet, her evaluation of another essay collection "Tenderness of the Night" was very low many years ago. She thought that it was too literary and artistic, nothing more than youth, absurdity, confusion and sadness. In contrast, "Seeing" won praises in a dusty posture.

While reading the book, I will copy the sentences that touch my heart, but I found out that the more touching part of me is not Chai Jing. What really makes this book quietly tremble on your nerves is her teachers, colleagues, relatives and friends, who understand, care and accompany them, and Chai Jing’s growth.
 
We often use a set of board effects to look at a person's life history. "What is this person like, so how do you see him or her?" In fact, when you think about it, people are people, not one. The gesture is a journey through life, but it is shaped step by step in a process, and finally self-complete. Like the flowing water, it has experienced the blockage of mountains and rivers, suffered from the shackles of sandstones, was caressed by the wind, was rained by the rain, and then followed what it had gone through, and became the final appearance. Chai Jing is like this, and we are the same.
 
Most people who love to read and think well are anti-social. They tend to grow ahead of the years in an overriding, lonely posture. As a result, most people make a mistake, look at the world we live in with a young boy's vision, and plan their own life in a way that they think they are excellent.
 
Just like Chai Jing will encounter bottlenecks, such a day we will wake up, the world is not what I thought, maybe I should have been like this. A lot of truth, you are familiar, but the understanding of pain and pain is finally to personal experience.
 
After reading "Seeing", the deepest feeling is here. Those knowledge, the spiritual wealth that we are proud of, when we have not experienced reality and have not experienced it, our minds are only their racecourses.

We have a lot to understand, we need a long time to grow, otherwise, what should we do in such a long life?

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>此书吧， 不适合入门用， 因为没有详细的解释：3D是什么？做3D都需要基本的数学知识， 这书用了极少的文字点了一下？3D应该怎么思考？等等
这书给你的只是点上面的知识， 而不是面的， 显得不连贯， 很分散， 僵硬
此书可以作为参考工具书，在你入门之后， 如果每个细节不是很清楚， 那么你需要哪块就到这里查看一下， 当然这书也就点为止， 仅通过一两个例子， 很粗糙的。
总结一句话， 这书不值81块， 最多30块已经不错了</text>

<summary_trans>I bought this book, not worth it.</summary_trans><text_trans>This book is not suitable for entry, because there is no detailed explanation: What is 3D? Doing 3D requires basic mathematics. Does the book use very few words? What should 3D think? and many more
This book gives you only the above knowledge, not the face, it seems incoherent, very scattered, stiff.
This book can be used as a reference book. After you get started, if every detail is not very clear, then which one do you need to check it out here, of course, the book is just a point, only one or two examples, very rough .
To sum up a sentence, this book is not worth 81, and at most 30 is good.</text_trans></item>

<summary>很不适合新手，仅仅适用有很好delphi基础的高手</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>书的内容是比较详尽的，但是很不适合完全不懂delphi的新手学习，书中的一些概念说得有点乱，重点也不突出。仅仅适用于一个老手用来复习拎知识点，或者用于考认证用。不建议购买。
忍不住又来追加评论，这本书实在太差了。首先，我认为既然名字起着基础教程，那么，对于简单的delphi基础，应该是由易到难，由普遍到特殊这么一个授课或者说授业的过程。好，你要看这本，直接吓死你，第二章开始，就有点看不懂了，不管是在文字阐释部分还是例子代码部分，你根本就没法理解例子跟文字有什么必要关系！或者例子比文字解释部分要更难！甚至，有的例子你压根就没看懂，你甚至没法明白为何例子里面为何出现某个函数或者行为而这个新的函数和行为又是什么意思！或许是我刚刚接触delphi，水平也十分有限，但也用着极大的耐心看完第5章，就已经对delphi产生了一种莫名的恶心感，实在坚持不下去了。现在换了其他的入门教程，进度很快，还比较舒适。
总体感觉：在购买某工具书籍的时候，一定要看好，这个书是给谁用的。请看好本书封面最上面的小字，如果您不是去考Borland认证的，我建议你还是换其他吧；如果你觉得我是黑，那你就买两本吧，厚度刚好当枕头。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Very unsuitable for novices, only for masters with a good delphi basis</summary_trans><text_trans>The content of the book is more detailed, but it is not suitable for novices who don't understand delphi at all. Some of the concepts in the book are a bit messy and the focus is not prominent. It is only suitable for a veteran to review the knowledge points, or for certification purposes. Not recommended to buy.
I can't help but add comments. This book is really bad. First of all, I think that since the name plays the basic tutorial, then for the simple delphi foundation, it should be from easy to difficult, from general to special such a process of teaching or teaching. Well, you have to look at this book and directly scare you. At the beginning of the second chapter, you can't understand it. Whether it's in the text explanation part or the example code part, you can't understand the necessary relationship between the example and the text! Or the example is more difficult than the text explanation part! Even, there are some examples that you don't understand at all. You can't even understand why a function or behavior appears in the example and what does this new function and behavior mean! Perhaps I just contacted Delphi, the level is very limited, but also with great patience after reading the fifth chapter, it has already produced an inexplicable disgusting feeling for delphi, it really can't go on. Now I have changed other introductory tutorials, the progress is very fast, and it is more comfortable.
The overall feeling: When buying a tool book, be sure to be optimistic about who the book is for. Please look at the top of the book cover, if you are not to test Borland certification, I suggest you change it; if you think I am black, then you buy two, the thickness is just a pillow.</text_trans></item>

<text>买了三本书，这本书是最不值的，刚刚看了一下，那里面的内容根本就是网上随便可以下载的。简直就是拼凑的，我记得当时买之前这本书好像不能在线阅读的。哎。。。。当时也是看了不少的人评价说不错才下手的。结果是失望啊，印刷是很漂亮，可惜内容空洞。竟然还出了第二册，真不知道这样的书怎么还能销售排行不错！！！</text>

<summary_trans>After I got my hand, I regretted it.</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought three books. This book is the least worthwhile. I just watched it. The content inside is simply downloadable online. It’s just a patchwork. I remember that the book didn’t seem to be online before I bought it. Hey. . . . At that time, I also saw a lot of people who commented that it was good to start. The result was disappointment, the printing was very beautiful, but the content was empty. Actually, I still have a second book. I really don’t know how such a book can sell well! ! !</text_trans></item>

<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这本书不单单介绍大数据，更注重介绍数据开放的一种世界趋势，政府在数据开放中应扮演的角色，也给我看到了未来中国还有许多要改进的地方，上一次信息革命是美国领衔，这次开放数据，开放政府同样是美国领衔。无关乎意识形态问题，未来势必是开放的，大数据底层的开放态度是未来政府的基石，也是推动经济和社会发展的原动力。此书甚好！！！</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>This book should read if you care about the future</summary_trans><text_trans>This book not only introduces big data, but also focuses on a world trend of data openness. The role that the government should play in data opening also shows that there are still many areas for improvement in China in the future. The last information revolution was The US led the open data, and the open government is also the US leader. Regardless of the issue of ideology, the future is bound to be open. The open attitude at the bottom of big data is the cornerstone of the future government and the driving force behind economic and social development. This book is very good! ! !</text_trans></item>

Here to remind everyone that the book is a three-dimensional painting 20 years ago. There are people who can't see three-dimensional paintings. If you don't understand, don't even mention the treatment. Just look at the three-dimensional painting, and see that it is also tired of the eyes, and the treatment is gone.</text_trans></item>

<text>首先声明：书刚到手，还没读，仅针对视觉感受进行评价。
印刷质量：
  封面：采用了盗版书最擅长的书名+推荐者姓名外凸印刷，且外凸部分和字体有错位；色彩暗淡。
  内容：纸张粗糙，有杂质。有些地方黑度不均匀，像是打印机缺墨。
  这么高的价钱，质量竟然跟街边10块钱一本的卡耐基全集质量差不多。真怀疑是不是买到盗版书了。
封面设计：
  封底是密密麻麻的推荐语，推荐人多达10位。感觉像是成功学书籍。、

<summary_trans>Practical meaning</summary_trans><text_trans>Reflection is an ability, but not everyone has this ability. Those who do not have such ability become parents. Naturally, they will not reveal the ability of reflection that they do not have.
However, this is indeed not an experience that everyone can learn or be familiar with. From our current education system, it is easy to cultivate blind generations from generation to generation. A blind person can only follow the pace of life of others and cannot ask the heart of the self. Life, life, and life will always be passive and difficult to find their true happiness.
I hope that I have the ability to reflect. This book reminds me again and gives some suggestions. It has practical meaning for me.

<summary>翻译的过分矫情了</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>纸质是很好。不过翻译的过于矫情了。简直怀疑它是不是几个大一学生直译出来的。目录大篇幅的超过两行不说，内容更是浮夸的敷衍。举个例子：第四章英版是：HOW THE SAME INSTITUTIONS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED OVER NEARLY ALL EUROPE,AND WERE EVERY WHERE FALLING TO PIECES。之前同学送了我1月份翻译的X出版社的一版，那个至少说的是人话。那版翻译是：为何欧洲制度如出一辙，并都陷入全面崩溃。 结果这本呢，这本的翻译是：何以几乎全欧洲都有完全相同的制度，它们如何到处陷于崩溃。——到处陷于崩溃？是为了翻译EVERY WHERE么！一个例子而已，反正我是读崩溃了。这是我买的读起来最差的版本。还是最贵的版本。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Translation is too much</summary_trans><text_trans>The paper is very good. However, the translation is too emotional. I wonder if it is a direct translation from several freshmen. The content of the catalogue is more than two lines, and the content is more exaggerated. For example: the fourth chapter of the English version is: HOW THE SAME INSTITUTIONS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED OVER NEARLY ALL EUROPE, AND WERE EVERY WHERE FALLING TO PIECES. Before the classmates sent me a version of X Publishing, which was translated in January, the one that said at least was human. That version of the translation is: Why the European system is exactly the same, and they are all in full collapse. The result of this book, this translation is: Why almost all of Europe has the same system, how they are everywhere collapsed. - Crashing everywhere? Is it for translating EVERY WHERE? An example only, anyway, I was reading a crash. This is the worst version I bought. Still the most expensive version.</text_trans></item>

<summary>Anita Woolfolk的〈教育心理学〉已包含了本书所有的内容</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>我为在这本书上花钱感到很后悔，原因如下：
1/ 错字挺多，感觉责编和译者没有把好出书前的最后审核关，而且行距太大，如果压缩一点，这本书估计不需要这么多页
2/ 作者所引用的别人的文字绝大部分都是上世纪90年代的，甚至更早，21世纪的东西很少，而且不超过2002年，这样就不得不让人考虑作者近几年干什么了？别人的最新发现作者都没注意吗？
3/ 如我标题所说，本书中讲的那些不仅Anita Woolfolk的〈教育心理学〉都囊括了，而且比他讲得更有实用价值。
4/ 其他几本早几年翻译过来的〈儿童心理学〉也比本书写得更详细，看本书有种被作者愚弄的感觉，而看过其他早几年翻译过来的〈儿童心理学〉则有被作者尊重的感觉。
反正我还是认认真真从头至尾看了一遍，没看到新意，只看到上述四条。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Anita Woolfolk's Educational Psychology contains all the content of this book.</summary_trans><text_trans>I feel sorry for spending money on this book for the following reasons:
1/ There are a lot of typos, I feel that the editor and the translator did not put the final review before the book is published, and the line spacing is too large. If it is compressed, this book does not need so many pages.
2/ Most of the texts quoted by the authors were in the 1990s, and even earlier, there were very few things in the 21st century, and no more than 2002, so that people have to consider what the author has done in recent years. ? Did anyone else notice the latest findings?
3/ As I said in the title, not only is Anita Woolfolk's Educational Psychology included in the book, but it is more practical than him.
4/ Several other "Child Psychology" translated in the early years are more detailed than this book. I have seen the book being fooled by the author, and I have seen other children's psychology translated in the early years. There is a feeling of being respected by the author.
Anyway, I still seriously read it from beginning to end, did not see the new ideas, only saw the above four.</text_trans></item>

<summary>亚马逊的态度让人失望</summary>

<text>很好的书  是给年轻人了解世界经济的一个很好的渠道
但是亚马逊的态度让我太失望了
刚买了一本 来的时候没有塑封 觉得有点奇怪 以为出版的时候就没有
同学看到说不错 让我帮她也买一本
结果第二本书一来一肚子气
首先时隔半个月 降价了 就算了 也没多少钱
包裹一拆开 第二本书是有塑封的
那为什么之前买的没有呢 是旧的嘛？！！！
一直听说亚马逊买书是旧的 都没在意 相信亚马逊是一个对消费者负责的大企业
但是自己收的东西才相信 亚马逊令人太失望了
希望亚马逊能给一个满意的解释 不然再也不在你家买东西了
旧的东西当新的卖 对消费者太不负责任了</text>

<summary_trans>Amazon's attitude is disappointing</summary_trans><text_trans>A good book is a good channel for young people to understand the world economy.
But Amazon’s attitude made me too disappointed.
I just bought one, I didn’t have a plastic seal. I felt a bit strange. I didn’t think it was published.
The classmates saw that it was good. Let me buy one for her.
The result of the second book is a sigh of relief
First, after half a month, the price has dropped. Even if there is not much money.
The package is unpacked. The second book is plastic.
Then why didn't you buy it before, is it old? ! ! !
I have always heard that Amazon is buying old books. I don’t care. I believe that Amazon is a big company responsible for consumers.
But I believe that Amazon is too disappointing.
I hope that Amazon can give a satisfactory explanation. Otherwise, I will never buy anything at your home.

尤其是“一剪”这个词在全文出现的次数不低于20次！！！在作者心中可能什么都能用这个词来形容。呵呵，一剪桃花，一剪圆月，一剪白云。。。。。。。。。

<summary_trans>Very disappointed.</summary_trans><text_trans>The first few articles are okay, and the more you look at it, the more you feel the same.
The author's writing skills are general, maybe I have higher requirements for the level of writing, and it seems very uncomfortable anyway. The same words are repeated many times, which is boring. Such as "one cut", "light", "safe" or something. .
In particular, the word "one cut" appears in the full text no less than 20 times! ! ! In the author's mind, anything can be used to describe this word. Oh, cut a peach, cut a round moon, cut a white cloud. . . . . . . . .

<summary>[转]郎咸平陈志武大X回马枪是各为其主</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>作者：金融赌场终结者
  郎咸平陈志武大X回马枪是各为其主(郎陈现象探究三）
  本文提要  前文已列举郎陈两教授分别对资本主义或社会主义大“X”回马枪的若干事迹。为何郎陈观点大相径庭，却均能当红中国？笔者细究发现：虽郎陈回马枪所“X”对象不同，但均是各为其“主”。通过对郎陈其“主”的透析可了解郎陈现象的深刻经济、政治及其人性内涵。
正文：
  前文已列举郎陈两教授分别对资本主义或社会主义大“X”回马枪的若干事迹。为何郎陈观点大相径庭，却均当红中国？也许读者已品出其中若干时代奇趣，或生疑问：郎陈摇唇鼓舌慷慨陈词、语不惊人誓不休，为的是那般？从网上搜寻答案，可见顶郎踩陈的网友为数众多，顶陈踩郎的亦为数不菲。真是郎说郎有理、陈说陈有理。
  笔者细究，发现郎陈不遣余力是各为其“主”：一是各为其主义;二是各为其主人。以下便由此对郎陈现象顺藤摸瓜，探个究竟。
  先看看郎陈各为何“主”义而忙活。郎陈皆性情中人。性情中人易为理想主义者，郎陈正是如此，读者想必有所同感。当然，也有网友发贴道：郎陈是为钱忙活，卖书卖咀皮口水，为赚个杯满钵满。这说的虽太直白，似乎有损郎陈教授的斯文体面，却是大实话。然而,望发财乃人之常情，为何独郎陈脱颖而出鹤立鸡群？二千年前司马迁已道破此中玄机： “古者富贵而名摩灭不可胜记，惟倜傥非常之人称矣。”郎陈作为著名经济学家，一在亚洲名居前列、一在世界排名202，盖非常人也，但要名贯神州尚需倜傥之性情，比如为理想敢于赴汤蹈火，在网上不惧千夫所指的义勇。郎陈两者皆备，又逢造英雄之时势，窜红华夏、亿众注目便顺理成章。先明此理方可对郎陈现象鞭辟入里。
  那郎教授为的是何理想、何主义呢？以笔者所知其书其言其行而论，郎教授的理想应是为中国富民强国多做贡献，蠃得青史流芳。郎教授所为主义，笔者认为首当其冲的是港人式爱国主义，带着几分殖民地孕育激发的民族正气骨气志气胆气，难能可贵。郎的经济学派属，笔者以为是倾向混合经济或均衡经济学说的。该学派起源于马克思奠基于凯恩斯集成于萨缪尔森，尽管萨氏声称其为实证经济学，但他将解决贫富分化、经济分配不公问题正式列为经济学重要内容，铺设了衔接规范经济学的康庄大道，后者是引入道德价值变量的经济学。作为斯密最杰出弟子的萨氏质疑斯密放任自由市场的著名论断，主张两只手调控的混合(均衡)市场经济，揭露市场与政府失灵的人性自私势力根源。郎观点近萨，可称正义经济学派，不盲目崇尚私有化，故能留心发现并勇于揭露中国私有化潮流中损公肥私、损民利私的偏激，成为狙击私化浊流、维护公众利益的中流砥柱。
  郎犹如深入资本主义铁扇公主心腹的孙大圣，对其五脏六腑或健康或疾患了如指掌，对国际金融大鳄的狼子野心洞若观火，常能一针见血道破新帝国主义金融与产业资本两路进军遏制与蚕食中国的种种阴谋伎俩，并为中国取得国际市场竞争战略主动权而出奇谋划良策。郎力倡制造业中心说，主张实体经济为本、虚拟经济为辅、两者协调发展，倾力抨击资本市场与房地产泡沫经济狂噬资金嗜于豪赌而令制造业贫血乏力的时弊。
  郎深知国际金融与产业大资本实力无比掠夺成性，他不厌其烦告诫国人：切莫屈服美欧压力顺其意志让人民币升值，切莫过早过快过度开放金融市场，以免重蹈日本及他国覆辙为国际金融大鳄所鱼肉，结局会比日本还要惨。郎可谓知己知彼，犹为知彼，对新帝国主义不抱丝毫幻想，他的回马枪鬼斧神功，“X”得出神入化，令人叹为观止。
  那陈教授为的又是何理想、何主义呢？以笔者所知不多的其书其言其行而论，愿意相信：以“为中国富民强国多做贡献，蠃得青史流芳的理想”而论，陈与郎多少可称异曲同工。但所为主义，陈与郎则近乎是分道扬镳。陈崇尚完全私有化+完全货币化，将金融的逻辑看作最高逻辑，属新经济自由主义派系。从上世纪八十年代苏东计划经济体制崩溃后，该流派便借势成了西方主流经济学派，声称：扳倒凯恩斯，回归斯密放任自由市场经济。这导致西方经济踏上了消费未来及至严重失控的金融泡沫化不归路，虽火旺一时，却为金融危机种下深根。该派极端人物甚至叫嚣“将正义从经济学词典永远删除”。</text>

<summary>不了解这段历史还是不要看了</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>如果对那段历史没有较深的了解，又想通过这本书去理解，我建议还是不要看了。作者自认为深受皇室的礼遇，立场偏颇。作者对于中国的的接触和理解仅限于满清皇室，对于中国底层的老百姓、改良派或者革命党基本没有什么接触了解，所以对于书中前几章关于满清末期的政见，异常可笑。
作者竟然认为如果没有袁世凯满清还可以继续存在下去，认为满清可以消灭革命或南北分治，因为王朝还有很多忠诚和有力的大臣；甚至可以退回满洲老家，并在那里复兴，在中国战乱的时候可以凭借皇室对老百姓的隆恩及老百姓对皇室的思念吞并热河和蒙古。。。。。。
庄士敦大人很忠诚，甚至比很多满清遗老忠诚
如果全当休闲或得到从侧面了解到当时的一些细节，另当别论。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Do not understand this history or do not read</summary_trans><text_trans>If you don't have a deep understanding of that history and want to understand it through this book, I suggest not to read it. The author believes that he is deeply favored by the royal family and has a biased position. The author's contact and understanding of China is limited to the Manchu royal family. There is basically no contact between the people at the bottom of China, the reformists, or the revolutionary party. Therefore, it is ridiculous for the political views of the last chapters of the book about the late Qing Dynasty.
The author even thinks that if Yuan Shikai is still full, he can continue to exist. He believes that Manchu can eliminate the revolution or divide the North and the South, because the dynasty still has many loyal and powerful ministers; it can even return to Manchuria's hometown, where it will be revived, and war in China. At that time, we can rely on the royal family's thoughts on the people's Ron and the people's thoughts on the royal family to annex the Rehe and Mongolia. . . . . .
Johnston’s adults are very loyal and even more loyal than many old people.
If you are all casual or get some details from the side, it's a different matter.</text_trans></item>

<summary>中文翻译误人不浅</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>刚好在台湾买了一本，很喜欢，打算送给朋友。于是在网上买了简体中文版。结果才知道中文翻译有多误人。所有的PPT的案例的英文完全不该翻成中文，因为那个完全破坏了原案例的美感。最可恶的是中文版的很多图片也换了。比如关于＂博客象鲨鱼＂那页的鲨鱼，完全没有了深海鲨鱼的感觉，被译者自以为是地换成了水族馆的鲨鱼。很多原版的彩页也没有了。很多的解释由于图片翻成了中文而让人误解，比如关于对齐的那一页所采用的案例英文版是向右对齐的，而中文版破坏了对齐，这让人很容易产生误解。
总之，如果没有看到原版我绝不可能买本书。而买了原版和中文版才知道原来国内的译者是多么不负责任。这是对原著的极大的曲解。很失望。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Chinese translation is not shallow</summary_trans><text_trans>I just bought one in Taiwan, I like it very much, I am going to give it to a friend. So I bought the simplified Chinese version online. As a result, I learned how many Chinese translations were wrong. The English of all PPT cases should not be translated into Chinese at all, because that completely destroyed the beauty of the original case. The most hateful thing is that many pictures of the Chinese version have also been changed. For example, the shark on the page of "Blog Like Shark" has no feeling of deep sea sharks. The translator is self-righteous and replaced with a shark in the aquarium. Many original color pages are gone. A lot of explanations are misunderstood because the pictures are turned into Chinese. For example, the English version of the case on the aligned page is aligned to the right, and the Chinese version breaks the alignment, which makes it easy to misunderstand.
In short, I can never buy a book without seeing the original. I bought the original and Chinese versions to know how irresponsible the domestic translators are. This is a great misinterpretation of the original. Very disappointed.</text_trans></item>

<text>准备去美国玩，买了几本书，对比此书和《畅游美国》，在厚度上，此书薄很多，便于携带，或引起读的兴趣；在内容上，此书句句实用，且附图圈点并一一说明；在结构上，此书的衣食住行适用于大多美国城市，而《畅游》则更多介绍四大城市的衣食住行，随细致，但赘述颇多，变成厚书一本；在常用英文词汇上，此书比《畅游》总结的细致，衣食住行皆配有常用词汇。此书的不足也很明显，因为薄，所以无法开枝散叶讲细讲透，很多内容点到为止，但即便这样，也是本好书，值得买！</text>

关于商品本身：
  《这个社会好吗》是熊培云又一力作。作者理性、冷静的表达自己对当前中国社会的看法。作者善于撰写社会时评，总能对当前社会热点提出自己独到的看法，揭露黑暗，但又不对社会失去希望，思维间透漏出社会能自我纠错的自信…… 别的  慢慢看再说吧。</text>

On the afternoon of February 17, I received the book and thanked the courier.
However, I would like to say that although the book was received, the excellence has been breached.
About the product itself:
  "How is this society?" is another masterpiece of Xiong Peiyun. The author expresses his views on the current Chinese society rationally and calmly. The author is good at writing social commentary. He always puts forward his own unique views on the current social hotspots, exposes the darkness, but does not lose hope to the society. The thoughts reveal the self-confidence of the society's self-correction... Let's take a look.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>I want to see this book if you want to be beautiful and can be beautiful and not lazy.</summary_trans><text_trans>I saw a small cloth show in Hunan. The book talks about the use of many skin care techniques and skin care products, beauty related knowledge, and recommended a lot of beauty items, many of which are also considered as civilians. I believe that they insist on doing the skin according to the book. There will be a big improvement. If you add blackheads, it will be more perfect.
Paper printing is good, and when you look through it, you can enjoy it. The gift calendar is also very beautiful, you can record your own beautiful diary.
If you want to be beautiful, you can be beautiful and not lazy, you can look at this book.</text_trans></item>

<summary>杨评</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>周老作为红学大家固然为一方神圣，但要说这本书我还真觉得不怎么样；不好意思，扫了各位高评的兴。
我真的觉得书里的内容东一榔头，西一棒槌的，好似周老在自说自话。可能周老由于太爱红楼了，因此也想普及之于芸芸众生中，但是学术文章做得好，不一定能写得好大白话的、简单易懂的普及文章。就像很多科学家钻研尖端科技很在行，但写不出给外行看的科普文章。如果周老不是给芸芸大众看的，那这书又是给谁看的呢，给红学家或准红学家看是不是又太浅了呢。
说这些都太抽象，那就举个例子，三联书店出版的“三联精选”系列专辑就挺不错，都是各方精英厚积薄发的小册子，晓畅明白，简练隽永；不管怎么说，也算是定位准确，找准目标读者群了。</text>

<summary_trans>Yang Ping</summary_trans><text_trans>As a red scholar, Zhou Lao is certainly a sacred one, but I really don’t think it is very good to say this book. Sorry, I have swept the high praise.
I really think that the contents of the book are a bit sloppy, and the West is awesome, as if Zhou Lao is talking to himself. Maybe Zhou Lao is too fond of the red building, so I want to spread it to the public, but the academic articles are well done, and it is not always possible to write a well-written and easy-to-understand popular article. Just as many scientists are studying cutting-edge technology, they can't write popular science articles for laymen. If Zhou Lao is not looking at the public, then who is this book for, is it too shallow for the red scientist or the prospective red scientist?
To say that these are too abstract, let's take an example. The "Sanlian Featured" series of albums published by Sanlian Bookstore is quite good. It is a booklet of all elites. It is clear and concise; in any case, it can be regarded as positioning. Accurate, identify the target audience.</text_trans></item>

The only advantage of this book is that the cover is beautiful. But what is the use of this? ! Isn't this an embroidery pillow? Really angry. So, if you have a higher demand for text, I advise you not to buy this translation. It’s too bad. I can see my brain hurts.</text_trans></item>

There is no progress. It is more stressful when playing in front of others. It is easy to be distracted. In the final analysis, the basic skills are not good. I hope this book can achieve the expected results. If it is DVD video teaching. Just like, the guitar book of Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House has a certain technical content. I have learned all the lessons. Oh, there are very few domestic guitar books. I have dozens of guitar books, but in general, Hunan literature and art. The guitar book of the publishing house, the guitar book of Liu Chuan Beijing Fenghua Art School (the publisher often changes), the guitar book of Jilin Audiovisual Press has a technical content (the guitar book introduced in Taiwan), as for the books of other publishers, really It’s a matter of opinion. It’s a good idea to buy books from other publishers. It’s really no technical waste. Just put a few chords and write a book, no matter how good or not.

<summary>一本很实用的书</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>我不清楚这本书是否是一本教材，但是显然我没有把它当作教材来阅读。
我已经读完了几个我很感兴趣的章节，大概占全书的2/3。作者写这本书的目的就是利用心理学知识帮助读者更好地分析生活中存在的重要问题，正如这本书的书名一样。
吸引我的是本书讨论的所有问题都是每个人都必须面对的。没有哪个人敢说自己从来没有想过这些问题：生命、死亡、自信、友谊、爱情等等。通过阅读这本书，能够从心理学角度帮助我理解分析自己的生活。同时也告诉我，大部分人面对这些问题的认知的选择。
在书中，作者并没有长篇累牍的介绍心理学对这些问题的详尽分析，没有数据、没有实验、有的只不过是一些结论罢了。
作为普通读者我不反对这样做。我不是想了解心理学角度如何论证结论的正确性，我只是想知道心理学是怎样解释问题的。
当然，需要注意的是，心理学在不断进步，现在看起来正确的分析结论和假设，未必是正确的。
说到底，这本书是一个参考手册，他提供了一些问题的解释，至于是否正确，我详细凡是科学的东西都是欢迎质疑和论证的。
总而言之，就这本书的内容而言，确实是一本值得一读的好书。</text>

<summary_trans>a very practical book</summary_trans><text_trans>I don't know if this book is a textbook, but obviously I didn't read it as a textbook.
I have read a few chapters that I am very interested in, which is about 2/3 of the book. The author's purpose in writing this book is to use the knowledge of psychology to help readers better analyze the important issues in life, just like the title of the book.
What appeals to me is that all the issues discussed in this book are something that everyone must face. No one dares to say that they have never thought about these problems: life, death, self-confidence, friendship, love, and so on. By reading this book, I can help me understand and analyze my life from a psychological perspective. At the same time, I also told me that most people face the cognitive choice of these issues.
In the book, the author does not have a lengthy and introductory introduction to the detailed analysis of these issues. There is no data, no experiments, and some are just some conclusions.
As an ordinary reader, I am not against it. I am not trying to understand how the psychological perspective demonstrates the correctness of the conclusion. I just want to know how psychology explains the problem.
Of course, it should be noted that psychology is constantly improving, and it seems that the correct conclusions and assumptions are not correct.
After all, this book is a reference manual. He provides some explanations of the problems. As for whether it is correct or not, everything that I have scientifically is welcome to question and argue.
All in all, as far as the content of this book is concerned, it is indeed a good book worth reading.</text_trans></item>

但是看后，觉得对男人有了一定的了解。

其实他没那么喜欢你。
一切不过是自欺欺人。</text>

<summary_trans>Yes, in fact, he doesn’t like you so much.</summary_trans><text_trans>Because it is written by foreigners, most of them are about sex. The author thinks that loving someone will be sexual. I feel that Chinese people are a little restrained, and they will not necessarily have sex.
But after reading it, I feel that I have a certain understanding of men.
He is jealous of you, he only occasionally texts you, he has a wife but also hooks you. . . . .
In fact, he doesn't like you so much.

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>这本书买过来后已经读了80多页了，发现虽被称为所谓的经典，但是从作者写书的思路来看，后面的内容中核心部分20页纸左右就可以写完，硬是被作者写成200多页，实在浪费大家的时间和金钱。我觉得本书就是作者讲座录音的整理稿，里面废话实在是多得不得了，图例也占去了总页数的2/3还多。连同同一作者所写的《日本蜡烛图教程》一样，重复的内容，废话实在太多。这次购书经历告诉我，决不能轻易相信任何所谓的经典书籍，在购买之前最好去图书馆借阅，实在值得购买再买。象这类书，实际上精髓部分只是极少，还不如自己摘抄总结出来比较好。</text>

<summary_trans>This book is actually very general</summary_trans><text_trans>After I bought this book, I have read more than 80 pages. I found that although it is called the so-called classic, from the point of view of the author's book writing, the core part of the following content can be written around 20 pages, which is hard to be finished. The author wrote more than 200 pages, which was a waste of everyone's time and money. I think this book is a compilation of the recordings of the author's lectures. The nonsense is really too much, and the legend also accounts for more than two-thirds of the total number of pages. As with the "Japanese Candlestick Tutorial" written by the same author, there is too much nonsense in the content of repetition. This book-selling experience tells me that I can't easily believe any so-called classic books. It is best to go to the library to borrow before buying. It is worth buying and buying. Like this kind of book, in fact, the essence of the book is only very small, it is better to sum up and summarize it better.</text_trans></item>

<text>本书开篇说是写给9岁的孩子的。我孩子11.本想给他看，我先拿来看看。
1. 排版、字体、印刷很不错
2. 书的内容的确挺好，是写给9岁孩子的语言。通俗的语言解释一些正式词汇。虽是写给9岁孩子的，但我看着一样有生字，有句型一下理解不了。所以原版的东西还是不错的。孩子直接看英文不行，但即使是看翻译的中文也很好，翻译的很好，很流畅，很专业，很正确。
3.我目前在看这个地理的第一本，看了10篇，这10篇都是描写美国本土的地理。写的真是很不错。</text>

<summary_trans>Reading</summary_trans><text_trans>The opening of the book is written for the 9-year-old child. My child 11. I wanted to show him, I will take it first.
1. Typography, fonts, printing is very good
2. The content of the book is really good, it is the language written to the 9-year-old child. The popular language explains some formal vocabulary. Although it was written for a 9-year-old child, I looked at it with the same words, and I couldn’t understand it with a sentence. So the original thing is still good. Children can't read English directly, but even Chinese who reads translations is very good. The translation is very good, very smooth, very professional and very correct.
3. I am currently reading the first book of this geography, and I have read 10 articles. These 10 articles are all about the geography of the United States. The writing is really good.</text_trans></item>

<text>看了一下，因为买的时候就是想看一下如何自然早起的，所以就先把那几个章节看了。
书的一开始就是先说了一堆早上起来的好处，之后再慢慢说如何早起。
总结起来非常简单，一就是要把床移到靠窗位置，阳光能照到的地方，然后拉开窗帘，第二天就慢慢等太阳照醒你吧。
二是如果窗户上有棵树，树上有窝鸟，效果更好。
嗯，就是告诉你如何运用自然的“闹钟”。
如果以上两个条件都做不到还是自己调个闹钟吧，它才是真爱。
其实归根结底还是要靠自己生物钟。</text>

<summary_trans>Not applicable to people in the accommodation</summary_trans><text_trans>I looked at it because I wanted to see how to get up early when I bought it, so I read those chapters first.
The beginning of the book is to say a bunch of benefits in the morning, and then slowly say how to get up early.
It is very simple to sum up. One is to move the bed to the window position, where the sun can shine, then open the curtains, and wait for the sun to wake you up the next day.
The second is that if there is a tree on the window, there are birds on the tree, and the effect is better.
Well, it is to tell you how to use the natural "alarm clock".
If you can't do the above two conditions, or adjust your own alarm clock, it is true love.
In fact, in the final analysis, it depends on your own biological clock.</text_trans></item>

<summary>又一本被高估和吹捧的流行作品</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>书的开头还算迷人，作者文笔流畅简约，满篇都透出一种人性的温暖和率真......可是当你读下去就会被一个又一个“爱”字搞得厌烦，还有关于什么宇宙之魂的理论，俨然一派黑格尔的“世界心灵”的论调，接着你就会明白，作者简直和宗教狂热分子别无二致，同时还继承了中世纪教徒的“人本论”，似乎全世界只有人类是高一等的造物。接近尾声之时，作者的叙述更加不知所以，而结尾则极尽煽情之能事。这类超现实的作品看过一些，不管是卡尔维诺还是马尔克斯，抑或是胡安.卢尔福，或者博尔赫斯，他们中没有一个不是深刻的，但他们却从不刻意去追求或者营造这种深刻。相比之下，柯艾略的这部作品乏善可陈，甚至非常幼稚，而且不停地把“爱”挂在嘴边的人总让我想到西方伪善的传教士。说实话，我不太喜欢这样一个大而空泛的故事，很喜欢超现实主义作品的我也被这部小说击败，读完之后竟然恨不得马上去找一本马克思的论著来解除我心头的腻歪。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Another popular work that is overrated and touted</summary_trans><text_trans>The beginning of the book is still fascinating, the author's writing is smooth and simple, and all the articles reveal a kind of human warmth and truth... But when you read it, you will be bored by one word after another, and still The theory of what the soul of the universe is, the argument of Hegel's "world mind", then you will understand that the author is almost the same as the religious fanatics, but also inherits the "humanism" of the medieval believers, it seems Only human beings in the world are high-class creations. At the end of the day, the author's narrative is even more ignorant, and the end is extremely sensible. Some of these surreal works have been seen, whether it is Calvino or Marquez, or Juan Lulfo, or Borges, none of them are not profound, but they never deliberately pursue or Create this depth. In contrast, Coello's work is lacking, even childish, and people who keep "love" in their mouths always remind me of Western hypocritical missionaries. To be honest, I don't really like such a big and empty story. I liked the surrealist works. I was also defeated by this novel. After reading it, I couldn't wait to find a Marx's argument to relieve my heart.</text_trans></item>

I searched for it at the time, and the price was 79.2 yuan. I feel satisfied, so I bought it. But why, in the later excellent recommendation, this set of books also appeared, but its offer is about 62 yuan? ? ? ? ! ! Why are the same books, the search price and the recommended price difference so much? ? ? ! ! Ok, this time, even, mailed the book. I will not return, just buy a lesson. I hope that there will be an explanation for excellence, and I hope that this will not happen in the future! This feeling is really damn disgusting.

<summary>盛名之下其实难副</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>季羡林《牛棚杂忆》一书已经读完，该书包含《牛棚杂忆》、《书斋杂录》、《病榻杂记》三个部分。当初之所以要买这本书，主要是看中《牛棚杂忆》这部分。上一阵子看了《夹边沟记事》，右派悲惨的故事给我前所未有的震憾，也让我对于人性有了更深刻的认识。为了解到更多关于右派或文革的事情，我想再多读一读这方面的文章。在网上查阅到季羡林所写的这本书也是关于右派的故事，也想看看作为当今的名人，他在反右的时候又经历过什么样的故事，所以才下定决定买这样的书的。
  对于共产党建国后文人写的东西，我一向是不喜欢看的。在意识形态的严重影响下，文人们总是瞻前顾后，前怕狼后怕虎，顾左右而言他，有了这样那样的顾虑，他们所写出来的东西又有多少能够直抒胸臆，真实的写出自己想法的呢？即使说出来的，在那么多编辑的的操刀下，在那么多个出版部门的严格把关下，又能留下多少有价值的东西呢？是以，我不喜欢看有意识形态方面的东西，这方面在大陆肯定不会客观描写的；我也不喜欢看建国后所写的东西，里面充斥着太多假大空。我还是喜欢看经典著作，这些东西被删除的可能性会比较低。我还喜欢看大陆以外的华人所写的作品。我读四大名著、南怀谨《论语别裁》、陈鼓应《老子道德经集注》、钱穆的《论语新解》等等，都是我这种观念在现实中的体现。
  季羡林这本书有三部份，中间的《书斋杂录》简直就是为了凑本书的字数，425页的书竟然占去了138页，文中的内容对于我等这些普通读者来说，毫无意义可言，难以下读，无法忍受的。这并不是他写得好不好的问题，而是跟本书的风格不一致，浪费读者的金钱和时间。另外《牛棚杂忆》也没有想象中写得的那么好，非常之简单，粗略，读起来有如小学生的水平，味同嚼腊。
  总之，将近一年来我所买的书有20本了吧，感到这本书最令我失望，不由得让我想起一句话，盛名之下，其实难副。对于季羡林来说，他在教育界的地位已经高到无可复加的地位了，在既得利益之下，还能够说出这些人话，也是难能可贵的。然而，也正是因为他的地位特殊，得到了许多既得利益，正所谓“吃人家的嘴软，拿人家的手短”，这种情况下，许多地方他不得不收敛或不可全抛一片心，也就理所当然了。是以，在他老人家来说，在那样的立场写出这样的东西来，我们是可以理解的，然而他写出这种有所保留的东西出来，看起来终究是无法淋漓尽致的。
  季羡林的这本书，也再一次证明我的预见性完全正确。以后要尽量避免购买诸如此类人在建国后所写的书。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Under the prestigious name, it is actually difficult.</summary_trans><text_trans>Ji Yulin's book "The Cowshed Miscellaneous Memories" has been read. The book contains three parts: "The Cowshed Miscellaneous Memory", "School Miscellaneous Record" and "Sick Bed Miscellaneous Notes". The reason why I wanted to buy this book was to focus on the part of "The Cowshed". I watched the "Clip Edge Ditch" for a while, and the tragic story of the right sent me an unprecedented shock, which also gave me a deeper understanding of human nature. In order to learn more about the right or the Cultural Revolution, I would like to read more articles in this regard. The book written by Ji Xianlin on the Internet is also about the story of the right, and I want to see what kind of story he experienced as a celebrity today, when he turned against the right, so he decided to buy such a book.
  I have always disliked what the literati wrote after the founding of the Communist Party. Under the serious influence of ideology, the literati always look forward to the future. Before the fear of the wolf, they are afraid of the tiger. Regarding the left and right, he has such concerns. How much of what they write can be straightforward and true. What do you think of yourself? Even if it is said, under the control of so many editors, how many valuable things can be left under the strict control of so many publishing departments? Therefore, I don't like to look at things with ideological aspects. This aspect will certainly not be objectively described in the mainland; I also don't like to read what I wrote after the founding of the People's Republic. It is filled with too many false big air. I still like to watch classics, and these things are less likely to be deleted. I also like to watch works written by Chinese outside the mainland. I read the four famous classics, Nan Huai's "The Analects of Confucius", Chen Guying's "The Laozi's Tao Te Ching Notes", Qian Mu's "A New Interpretation of the Analects", etc., are my embodiment of this concept in reality.
  Ji Yanlin has three parts in this book. The middle of the "Books of the Book" is simply to make up the number of words in the book. The 425-page book actually takes up 138 pages. The content in the text is meaningless to me and other ordinary readers. At a time, it is difficult to read and can’t stand it. This is not a question he wrote well, but it is inconsistent with the style of the book, wasting the money and time of the reader. In addition, "The Cowshed Miscellaneous Memories" is not as good as it was supposed to be written. It is very simple, rough, and reads like the level of a primary school student.
  In short, I have bought 20 books in the past year. I feel that this book is the most disappointing to me. I can't help but think of a sentence. Under the prestigious name, it is actually difficult. For Ji Xianlin, his position in the education sector has reached an unrecognizable position. Under the vested interests, it is also commendable to be able to speak these words. However, it is precisely because of his special status that he has obtained many vested interests. The so-called "eat people's mouth is soft, take people's hands short", in this case, in many places he has to converge or not throw a heart, also Take it for granted. Therefore, in his old man's position, it is understandable to write such a thing in such a position. However, he wrote such a reserved thing and it seems that he could not do it in the end.
  This book of Ji Xianlin once again proves that my foresight is completely correct. In the future, try to avoid buying books written by people like this after the founding of the People's Republic of China.</text_trans></item>

Looking back at the cover, it is also different from the one shown on the display: NEW EDITION The circular symbol at the beginning of the following three sentences has become three semicircles in my case.
  So I asked for a replacement. In the second receipt inspection, it was found that there was still a problem of black watercolor painting, but it was not on the first page.

It's a lot lighter than the heart of the painting. If you have a heart, you can compare it with 24-25P or 38-39P. The color doesn't have to be seen. . . And the tailoring of the book is not good. This quality is no different from pirated books. Printing like this is completely ruining the paintings of Xia Da. So I strongly condemn the publishing house and the printing house here!

1条回应：
amazom 2009-02-05 21:45:01
您好，谢谢您的宝贵意见。本书关于色轮的地方颜色是有些偏差，是因为印刷时喷枪的使用出了问题，不是因为纸张的问题。
这个问题会给读者不好的印象，但是不会影响本书的阅读，更不会影响该书的价值。本书即将重印，重印时我们会纠正这个错误。
再次表示感谢。

Leechboy rates this product:
I bought this book, and everything else is very good, but there is a very important question. In the chapter of the color wheel, there is a problem with printing, and the red and blue colors are color cast. This is easier to mislead the beginners. I hope the publisher will make the next edition. Use a good piece of paper to solve the problem - response (1)

Amazom 2009-02-05 21:45:01
Hello, thank you for your valuable comments. The color of the book on the color wheel is somewhat different because of the problem with the use of the spray gun during printing, not because of paper problems.
This problem will give the reader a bad impression, but it will not affect the reading of the book, and will not affect the value of the book. This book is about to be reprinted, and we will correct this error when it is reprinted.
Thanks again.
(When is the "reprint" mentioned in the response implemented? I would like to buy ~ please give a clear reminder: reprint the version! For the reader to buy!) Thanks~</text_trans></item>

<summary>很棒</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这本书适用于所有服务于企业的公司（如供应商、广告公司、顾问公司等），视角是从这些公司的立场出发的，所以可以学到很多非常有用又可能被忽略的点。然后，这本书还很适合管理者，因为作者本身就是从管理者出发，也传授了很多管理经验，参考价值很大~虽然我就职的公司属于被服务的企业，也还不是一个管理者，但是还是可以从书中学到很多职场通用的知识，也可以了解到服务于我的公司是怎么思考的，这样可以加强我们之间的沟通与理解，帮助有效愉快地达成交易~~~</text>

<summary_trans>Great</summary_trans><text_trans>This book applies to all companies that serve the enterprise (such as suppliers, advertising agencies, consultants, etc.). The perspective is from the standpoint of these companies, so you can learn a lot of useful and negligible points. Then, this book is also very suitable for managers, because the author itself is from the manager, but also taught a lot of management experience, the reference value is very large ~ although the company I work for belongs to the serviced enterprise, it is not a manager, However, I can still learn a lot of general knowledge from the book, and I can also understand how the company that serves my company thinks, which can strengthen communication and understanding between us and help to achieve effective and happy transactions~~~</text_trans></item>

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>作为一个新手，看到大家对此书的评论，我还是忐忑的买下来了，也不是很贵，90块而已。但是这本书拿到手之后，随便翻了一下，还真的是后悔了。并不是钱多少的问题，而是这个钱花的很不值。至少我认为完全没有意义，如果再有买此书的人，建议在网上随便找点资料看就好了。就当做是花钱买教训吧。90块并没有起到90块应有的价值。这就是我的个人看法。</text>

<summary_trans>Not recommended to buy</summary_trans><text_trans>As a newbie, I saw everyone's comments on this book, I still bought it, not very expensive, only 90 pieces. But after the book was handed, I flipped it over and it was really regrettable. It's not a question of how much money, but the money it costs is not worth it. At least I don't think it makes sense at all. If there are people who buy this book again, it is recommended to find some information on the Internet. Just think of spending money to buy lessons. 90 pieces did not play the value of 90 pieces. This is my personal opinion.</text_trans></item>

本书的内容一直值得人们称道，但是纸质、印刷，排版都足以让拿到这本书的人失望。

由此亦可以判断出来，亚马逊卖出的这一本书也许不是正版的。

<summary>书是好书，翻译差</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>根据经验，很多国外好书一旦落入中国不负责任的翻译、出版社手中，就会被糟蹋的很惨。最糟糕的是，很多还是高校教科书，上一次中招是《简明逻辑学导论》。这次在购买前先看了这里的书评，一旦看到有翻译烂的评价，就会很警觉。 真想骂那些出版社和翻译，这样荼毒国人，你们还有良知吗？
香港诚品花了150多港元买了 台湾版的《快思慢想》，看得很舒服，无论是纸质、字体大小、繁体字这些硬件，还是翻译者的语言。在香港买的时候。特意看了一下原版，知道以自己的英语水平比较难舒服地看，而且本书的内容本身就不会像很多畅销书那样非常易读（词汇、句子）。所以就买了台湾版。折算127块左右的价钱（注：广州的话太古汇里面的“方所”书店有卖，132元），比国内的贵，但是如果想看好的译本和畅快的阅读体验，这个钱还是在其他地方省吧。
特意到书店找了简体版的《思考，快与慢》。差异很大。首先书背面的那些"名家推荐"变成了国内的知名人士，然后在内文翻译者没有作序，也没有相关学术界知名人士对本书的推荐文字。字体比台湾版的小，读起来累一点，纸质很薄。到了正文部分，差异就明显得很了，基本上是直译，也就是字面义。一堆没有生气的文字，死气沉沉的译本。更不用说出错的高可能性了。
其实买书时没听说过台湾版译者洪兰，维基上有大家可以查查。看洪兰女士的译本，可以看出她的用心：一、本身就是心理学的专家；二、对原书有爱；三、对读者有心。因此翻译得精准、易读。
个人认为，如果是易读的畅销书，还是读原版。如果像这种要看翻译本的好书，不要浪费钱买中信这些出版社的译本了......简直是糟蹋原书</text>

<summary_trans>The book is a good book, poor translation</summary_trans><text_trans>According to experience, many good foreign books will be ruined once they fall into the hands of irresponsible translators and publishers in China. The worst part is that many of them are college textbooks. The last time they were recruited was "Introduction to Concise Logic." I read the book review here before I buy it. Once I see a bad translation, I will be very alert. I really want to marry those publishers and translators, so that you are poisonous, do you still have a conscience?
Hong Kong Eslite spent more than 150 Hong Kong dollars to buy the Taiwan version of "Thinking Slowly", which is very comfortable, whether it is paper, font size, traditional Chinese characters, or the translator's language. When I bought it in Hong Kong. I looked at the original version deliberately, knowing that it is more difficult to read with my English level, and the content of the book itself is not as easy to read (words, sentences) as many bestsellers. So I bought the Taiwan version. Converted to the price of 127 or so (Note: Guangzhou's "Taiwan" bookstore in Taikoo Hui has sold, 132 yuan), more expensive than domestic, but if you want to see a good translation and enjoyable reading experience, this money is still elsewhere Let's save it.
Deliberately went to the bookstore to find the simplified version of "Thinking, Fast and Slow." big difference. First of all, the "recommended by famous artists" on the back of the book became domestic celebrities, and then the internal translators did not preface, nor did they have the recommended texts of the famous academics. The font is smaller than the Taiwan version, it is a bit tired to read, and the paper is very thin. In the body part, the difference is obvious, basically literal translation, which is literal. A bunch of lifeless words, a deadly translation. Not to mention the high possibility of error.
In fact, I have never heard of the Taiwanese translator Hong Lan when I bought the book. You can check it on the wiki. Looking at Ms. Hong Lan's translation, she can see her intentions: First, she is an expert in psychology; Second, she has love for the original book; Third, she is interested in the reader. Therefore, the translation is accurate and easy to read.
Personally think that if it is an easy-to-read bestseller, read the original. If you want to read a good book like this, don't waste money on the translation of these publishing houses of CITIC... it is a waste of the original book.</text_trans></item>

<summary>翻译得什么玩意</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>约翰霍兰德博士的书很棒，可惜找错了翻译的人。在我看过的外文翻译著作中，《涌现》和这本《隐秩序》无疑是失败中的经典。译者明显是读过中学的，语文明显是没有及过格的。态度也不认真，中文版71页图2.11中的最后一句话应翻译为“……该模式也不会被打乱”，这个不用看英文原版就知道翻译错了。翻译是一件很难的事。有千分之一的话没翻译好，读者的感觉就像是从书里翻出来一坨屎一样。昨天嗓子发炎，扁桃体也肿得厉害，还是花了3个多小时看了100页，越看越觉得霍兰德了不起，越觉得翻译得烂。这么好的思想被中文翻译成这样，心里很难过。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>What is the translation?</summary_trans><text_trans>Dr. John Holland's book is great, but unfortunately the person who found the wrong translator. In the foreign translation works I have read, "Emerging" and this "Hidden Order" are undoubtedly the classics of failure. The translator is obviously reading middle school, and the language is obviously not overkill. The attitude is not serious. The last sentence in Figure 2.11 of the Chinese version on page 71 should be translated as "...the mode will not be disrupted". This does not need to look at the original English version to know that the translation is wrong. Translation is a very difficult thing. If one thousandth of the words are not translated, the reader feels like a look out of the book. Yesterday, the throat was inflamed, and the tonsils were swollen. It took more than three hours to read 100 pages. The more I saw it, the more I felt that Holland was great, and the more I thought it was bad. Such a good thought was translated into Chinese like this, and I was very upset.</text_trans></item>

你一定会从其著作中找到你所需要的，这就是好的作者！
好书如同美食佳肴，要与朋友们共同分享。
人不仅要穿衣服，还要读书。
衣物遮体，读书则是让你日渐荒芜的心灵早日变成绿洲；让你的孩子看到你是一棵真正的可以问道的大树。
朋友们，快拿出你１％的收入来尽情的读书吧。
不要让别人再看到你的大脑、你的心灵是光秃秃的，怎么没有穿衣服？</text>

You will definitely find what you need from its work, this is a good author!
Good books are like food and food, to share with friends.
People must not only wear clothes, but also study.
Clothing cover, reading is to make your increasingly ridiculous soul into an oasis as soon as possible; let your child see you are a real tree that can be asked.
Friends, take out your 1% income and enjoy reading.
Don't let others see your brain again, your heart is bare, why not wear clothes?</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Forever Zangyang Gyatso</summary_trans><text_trans>In the world, the two laws are perfect, and they don’t live up to the present. In fact, you have not lived up to anything, and you have never betrayed your heart and your lover.
When the young Sixth Dalai Cangyang Gyatso disappeared mysteriously on the infinite escorting journey, his earthly life was over and his legendary story began. His love and poetry, his inner joy and his life encounters, make the whole sacred Tibetan land addicted to the cold and warmth of the human heart.
The mystery of life and death is no longer important, because we feel that he has been there all the time, but he has never met. What he wants is no different from the world.
His life is rugged; his existence is handed over to God.</text_trans></item>

<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>原本的想法，是这套MP3假如下载非常困难，或者需要交钱才能下之类，我得到后一定共享。但联系以后，博主的反应很快，我第二天就下载成功，所以就不上传了。
在此仅提供一篇课文的阅览，也就是【卓越在线试读】最末尾的那一篇文章第六本书第七篇课文。 115：anikfixg
因为还没买书前，我想先听一下MP3音质朗诵如何，但硬是找不到，联系博主也没办法。只有在卓越拍下后，才下载的。所以建议大家有需要就先听吧，多点选择后再考虑是否入手。
我个人对此非常满意。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>About MP3</summary_trans><text_trans>The original idea is that if this MP3 is very difficult to download, or you need to pay the money, you must share it after I get it. But after the contact, the blogger's response was very fast. I downloaded it the next day, so I didn't upload it.
Here, only one text is provided, which is the seventh text of the sixth book in the last article of [Excellent Online Trial]. 115: anikfixg
Because I haven't bought a book before, I want to listen to the MP3 sound quality, but I can't find it. There is no way to contact the blogger. It is only downloaded after the excellent shot. Therefore, it is recommended that you listen to it if you need it. If you choose more, then consider whether to start.
I am very satisfied with this.</text_trans></item>

<summary>不曾显赫的大家</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>我起初知道郭在贻先生是因为他是姜亮夫、蒋礼鸿等学术大家的弟子，又在一些文章中得知郭先生除了在训诂学上堪称巨擘外，对于楚辞学、敦煌学也有深入的研究。他淡于名利，在杭州大学执教一生，仅五十岁即英年早逝。先生的著作不多，就算这本《训诂学》也未在他生前享有应得的名望。在如今百花齐放的教材出版界，《训诂学》也有十余种版本，自然也存在良莠不齐，郭先生的这本呕心沥血之作终于让人感受到了其作为经典的价值。
  读古书不能不具备基本的训诂学常识，训诂学的内容主要是释词和解句，以及辨析古书异例；在阅读古籍时我们应注重解释词义、分析语法及修辞。戴震说，“凡学始乎离词，中乎辨言，终乎闻道”。勉之。郭先生的这册教材贵在创见与实用，从其第四章“训诂的条例、方式和术语”。可见一斑。允我摘录如下：
  1．条例三则。形训，指用分析文字形体的方法来解释字义。声训，或音训，指取声音相同或相近的字来解释字义。义训，指以通行词训释古词语或方言词的意义。2．方式三种。互训，指用同义词或近义词相互解释的一种释词方式。推原，或推因指根据词的声音线索，探索词义的由来。义界，指用一句或几句话来阐明词义的界限，对词所表示的概念的内涵作出阐述或定义。……
  一本好的教材必能经得住时间的考验，必能经得住一代代挑剔的教师与学生的考验，而编写这册优秀教材的是一位不曾显赫的大家，我们要心怀敬意，毕竟我们是站在了前人的肩膀上，是他们用心血为后学铺垫了做学问的坚实基础。</text>

<summary_trans>Not everyone who is so prominent</summary_trans><text_trans>At first, I knew that Mr. Guo Zaijun was because he was a disciple of Jiang Liangfu, Jiang Lihong and other academics. In some articles, he learned that Mr. Guo is also a great researcher in the field of exegesis and Dunhuang studies. He is less than fame and fortune. He taught at Hangzhou University for a lifetime. He was only 50 years old and died young. There are not many books written by Mr., even if this "Exegesis" did not enjoy the reputation he deserved before his death. In today's textbook publishing industry, there are more than ten versions of the "Exhibitions", and there are naturally many differences. The painstaking work of Mr. Guo finally feels its value as a classic.
  Reading ancient books can not but have basic exegetical knowledge. The content of exegesis is mainly interpretation and interpretation, as well as analysis of ancient books. When reading ancient books, we should pay attention to explaining meaning, analyzing grammar and rhetoric. Dai Zhen said, "Where the study begins with the words, the middle is arguing, and the end is heard." Oh. Mr. Guo’s book is expensive in terms of creativity and practicality, from its fourth chapter, “Regulations, Methods and Terminology”. It can be seen. Allow me to extract the following:
  1. The third rule. Formal training refers to the use of methods to analyze the form of words to explain the meaning of words. Sound training, or sound training, refers to words with the same or similar sounds to explain the meaning of words. The righteousness refers to the interpretation of the meaning of ancient words or dialects by means of universal words. 2. Three ways. Mutual training refers to a way of interpreting words that are explained by synonyms or synonyms. The original, or push, refers to the origin of the meaning of the word based on the sound clues of the word. The righteousness refers to the use of one sentence or a few sentences to clarify the boundaries of the meaning of a word, and to elaborate or define the meaning of the concept represented by the word. ......
  A good textbook will be able to stand the test of time, and it will be able to withstand the test of a generation of discerning teachers and students. The author of this excellent textbook is a person who has never been so prominent. We must respect it. After all, We are standing on the shoulders of our predecessors, and they are a solid foundation for their study of the postgraduate study.</text_trans></item>

<text>在澳门工作了两年，在异乡拼搏的日子里看到张杰这小子打不死的拼快男，我才知道，在那撒满无奈和隐忍的三年，在我快乐的实现着自己的梦想的同时，这个充满天赋的孩子和我一起在我的城市里并肩，我却不曾知道他一丝一毫。。。
可想而知上腾对他如何，也从那时候起我决定要尽全力帮助他实现梦想。在百度贴吧里跟着所有星星的号召捐款，UC，投票，同喜同悲了不知道多少回，巡演、EP、商演，有需要钱和支持的地方，就有我。
看完这本书，您一定能理解我的坚持，因为这是每个有思考，善良并且客观的人都会动容的事，一个天生的歌者，一个当初踌躇满志闯荡上海却黯然离开的小孩，一个用真诚和内敛直面不公的男生，我知道，您一定能理解！</text>

<summary>与“轻小说”唯一的区别，就是作者不是日本人。</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>一位印度教素食者皈依了基督教伊斯兰教，在船上漂流的时候吃了许多肉，上岸之后遇到两个满口美式笑话的日本人。
——只需一句话，就可以看出这个故事的漏洞是有多么明显。
并没有人要求作者完全符合现实，与老虎漂流或者食人岛的存在我们不得而知，因此作者可以进行适当的创作夸大甚至是胡编乱造。
但是与现实联系的那些内容，就不能够偏离事实太远了。
一个出于信仰上的素食者是绝对不会为了活命而吃肉的。作者却用了“在这种情况下”这种近乎无理取闹的方式打破了这一原则。
而宗教信仰方面，Pi作为一个印度教徒出生，那么他就不可能有机会接触到基督教会。
在印度，Pi进入教堂的第二天，那个教堂就会被狂热的暴民给烧掉。这一切与Pi和神父的意志无关。清真寺同理。
而日本人的思维模式与美国人完全不同，“香蕉骨头”那种美式笑话不可能出于日本人之口。
所以作者所描绘的世界，只能说是他的想象。那些角色也不是真正的人，而是依据作者个人的意愿而活动与思考的，一种思维方式完全异于人类的生物。
有很多人说这部作品“深入人的内心”。
那么，一部以“不是人的生物”为主角的故事，又怎样深入人的内心呢？
而“让人相信上帝”。
这种生物是为了生命可以随时放弃信仰的。他们有什么立场谈论上帝呢？
内容只是这本书的硬伤其一，其二是书腰上的一句话：
欧洲著名插画家精心绘制的数十幅全彩插图。
插图就算了，还全彩。真把这本书当“轻小说”了么？
一本优秀的小说，它的价值是不会被插图影响的。
只有一本拙劣的作品，配上插图之后才有可能增加它的价值。
排除掉编辑智商的因素，会把“全彩插图”当做宣传的唯一理由就是：
出版商对这本书并没有信心。
一本出版商都没有信心的书，又怎么能让读者满意呢？
主角是思维与人类完全不同的生物，出版社通过插图进行宣传。
这部小说，就是个作者是加拿大人的“轻小说”。</text>

<summary_trans>The only difference from "light novels" is that the author is not Japanese.</summary_trans><text_trans>A Hindu vegetarian has converted to Christian Islam and ate a lot of meat while drifting on the boat. After landing, he met two Japanese who were full of American jokes.
- In just one sentence, you can see how obvious the loopholes in this story are.
No one has asked the author to be completely in line with reality. We are not aware of the existence of tiger drifting or cannibalism, so the author can make appropriate creations and exaggerations or even arbitrage.
But those things that are related to reality cannot be far removed from the facts.
A vegetarian who is a believer is never going to eat meat for a living. The author broke the principle by using the almost unreasonable way of "in this case."
In terms of religious belief, Pi was born as a Hindu, so he could not have access to the Christian Church.
In India, the next day Pi enters the church, the church will be burned by the fanatic mob. All this has nothing to do with Pi and the priest's will. The mosque is the same.
The Japanese's thinking mode is completely different from that of the Americans. The American joke of "banana bones" cannot be the mouth of the Japanese.
Therefore, the world depicted by the author can only be said to be his imagination. Those characters are not real people, but are activities and reflections based on the individual wishes of the authors. A way of thinking is completely different from human beings.
There are many people who say that this work "goes deep into people's hearts."
Then, how can a story with a "non-human creature" be the main character?
And "people believe in God."
This kind of creature is for life to give up faith at any time. What position do they have to talk about God?
The content is only one of the hard marks of this book, and the second is a sentence on the waist of the book:
Dozens of full-color illustrations carefully drawn by famous European illustrators.
Even the illustrations are still full. Did you really regard this book as a "light novel"?
An excellent novel whose value is not affected by illustrations.
Only a poor work, with an illustration, can increase its value.
Excluding the factors that edit IQ, the only reason to use "full color illustrations" as propaganda is:
Publishers have no confidence in this book.
How can a book that publishers have no confidence, and how can they satisfy readers?
The protagonist is a creature whose thinking is completely different from that of human beings. The publishing house promotes it through illustrations.
This novel is a "light novel" by the author.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Little value~</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought more than N books in Amazon, and the first time I wrote a comment, mainly because of disappointment.
I have seen Mr. Li zero’s "Bing with swindling" and I feel very enjoyable. I bought this book with great expectations. However, after reading a lot of books on the Book of Changes, this book is not of much value. The main part is a simple explanation of the sixty-four hexagrams. The latter is "Yi Chuan", which introduces the general meaning in a few words, and there are not many new things. It feels like hype.

Each of these patients will have a magical effect after listening to the author's words, and any disease will be good. A little bragging.

月。 玉。
这种格式的穿插叙述，确实很有意思，
但是，有太明显的故事不连续性，
牵强的把2个故事，摞到了一起。
思想性，根本看不到，
平淡的叙述风格，跟朱德同志的写作很像，可能是小学课本毒害结果。
语言，淡，跟大师相去甚远；
对问题的认识很肤浅，很有大家闺秀的意思。
虽然穿插了2战，并描写了希特勒轰炸英国的事件，
明显感觉到，他站在了一个太远的地方，这些部分不如直接剔除掉，
对整个故事来是，插的太生硬，或许单独拿出来写个短篇，会更好。
对于文革，显然是那个时代想说，又不敢说的状态，
不像个文人；很没有筋骨那种，即使算的话。
毕竟是很厚的一本书，
对这么有写作能力的人，
我们还是要敬仰一下。</text>

The interspersed narrative of this format is really interesting.
However, there are too obvious story discontinuities,
Forced to bring the two stories together.
Ideological, can't see it at all,
The plain narrative style is very similar to Comrade Zhu De's writing, which may be the result of poisoning the primary school textbook.
Language, light, far from the master;
The understanding of the problem is superficial, and everyone has a good meaning.
Although interspersed with two wars, and described Hitler’s bombing of the British,
It is obvious that he is standing too far away, and these parts are not as straightforward as they are.
For the whole story, it’s better to insert it too hard, or to write a short story alone.
For the Cultural Revolution, it is obviously the state that I want to say in that era, and I dare not say it.
Not like a literati; there is no such thing as a bone, even if it counts.
After all, it is a very thick book,
For those who have the ability to write,

<summary>中国企业正走在一条危险的道路上</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>如果说大卫&amp;#8226;奥格威的《一个广告人的自白》是广告界的“圣经”，菲利普&amp;#8226;科特勒的《市场营销管理》是营销界的“圣经”，那么，里斯先生和特劳特先生合著的《定位》可以称得上是营销策划界的“圣经”。当然，里斯先生和特劳特先生并不满足于自己的理论成为说教式的教义，于是，在1993年，二人联手将定位理论浓缩为能够决定市场营销胜败的22条简明法则——《22条商规》。
  在这22条定律中，除了“品类定律”和“心智定律”外，里斯先生的远见更是在“牺牲定律”和“聚焦定律”中得到淋漓尽致的体现。虽然有人批评里斯先生，说他是这个星球上最坚决的“品牌泛化的反对者”。但是这么多年来，中外无数企业的兴衰成败不断用事实证明着“智者的先知先觉”。坚持大摩托的哈雷—戴维森屹立90年不倒，不断多元化的卡马特申请破产；独守肉类产业链的双汇风生水起，遍布各大品类的“第五季”黯然退场。
  目前，源自美国的金融危机已演变为席卷全球的经济危机，对于转型中的中国企业，这既是生死攸关的挑战，也是凤凰涅槃的机会。越来越多的企业家们开始认识到市场营销的重要性，已经有不少人明白了“营销”与“销售”的本质区别。可以断言，率先走出危机的一定是那些把营销放在企业战略高度考量的“先知先觉者”。可是对于只经历了30年粗放发展、很少真正关注市场的中国企业来说，如何制定营销战略、并利用营销战略将自己的企业从“中国制造”转向“中国创造”、从“中国产品”变为“中国品牌”将是首先面对的难题。修订版的《22条商规》从多个角度为不同企业选择营销战略提出了有益的建议。你会发现：无论是市场领先者还是市场追随者，甚至是市场利基者与迟到者，都可以从中找到适合自己的营销战略。</text>

So I downloaded this translation and Yu Xiaodan's translation from the Internet. Two pages were read in comparison, and each line was carefully compared. It was found that this translation was really bad, and the meaning of the original text was not translated at all. Some people say that this translation is a literal translation, it is not right. If the translation can't translate the meaning of the original text, but only translate the words, how can it be translated literally? Cat and dog, placed behind the rain is the meaning of "downpour", if translated literally into "cats and dogs", is this a literal translation? ! It is strongly not recommended to read this version. I also recommend the translation of Xiaodan.</text_trans></item>

<summary>两个伟大的人和一本平凡的书</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>早上起床读完了《林肯传》，买这本书的起因是想看看葛底斯堡的演讲，可惜本书为此着墨寥寥。
对林肯最早的印象源于中学的英语课本，林肯的父亲让他成为一个诚实的人是尽人皆知的故事，这本书也没有相关描述，看来那个故事兴许有杜撰的成分。
戴尔卡内基《人性的弱点》照亮过很多人的人生，可这本传记却写得很平凡甚至有些平庸，没有吸引人的情节，所有的描述给我的感觉是在读报纸上的新闻，卡老先生的文采是否被译文的水平降低就不得而知了，反正看原著是件及其吃力的事情。
但这一切掩盖不了他们都是伟大的人。
林肯是有大爱的人，他的种种生平就像是上帝的另一个儿子在带领人间走向光明，这一次他更关注的是黑人。
林肯14岁才开始学习文化，却成为了美国历史上最杰出的总统之一和最伟大的演说家之一着实让人景仰，但书中并没有有力的说明小阿贝成功的原因，至少是一些导致成功的故事。
林肯的政治主张也被很少提及，能够成为总统在本书中表现出的偶然性让人觉得是天父的力量，难道仅仅是不愿提及美国当时的社会文明低下吗？
林肯夫人的描绘是很用了些力气的，但和真正意义上的传记还相去甚远，仅仅用一些评估（难以认为是评价）来描绘成功男人背后的女人多少还是有些苍白，况且这种意义上的反衬是为了说明林肯的伟大吗？中国人的“修齐治平”难道不是放之四海皆准的吗？至少我不认为一个家庭如此不和谐的人会有多么大的成就，承受如此多的苦难仍然能够成为民族英雄非神不可啊。
有时间再去看看别人写的林肯吧，看看他老人家是不是一生都生活在水深火热当中，经常以泪洗面而不朽？</text>

<summary_trans>Two great people and an ordinary book</summary_trans><text_trans>I got up in the morning and finished reading "Lincoln Biography". The reason for buying this book is to look at Gettysburg's speech. Unfortunately, this book is inked.
The earliest impression of Lincoln stemmed from the English textbook in middle school. The story of Lincoln's father who made him an honest man is a well-known story. There is no description of this book. It seems that the story may have a fabricated content.
Dell Carnegie's "Humanity Weakness" illuminates many people's lives, but this biography is written very ordinary and even mediocre, without an appealing plot. All the descriptions give me the feeling that I read the news in the newspaper. Whether Mr. Ka Lao’s literary talents are lowered by the level of the translation is not known. Anyway, it is a difficult thing to look at the original work.
But all this can't hide them are great people.
Lincoln is a man of great love. His life is like another son of God leading the world to light. This time he is more concerned about black people.
Lincoln started learning culture at the age of 14, but became one of the most outstanding presidents in the history of the United States and one of the greatest speakers. It is really admirable, but there is no strong explanation for the success of Little Abbe, at least Some stories that lead to success.
Lincoln’s political proposition is also rarely mentioned. Being able to become the president’s contingency in this book makes people feel the power of the Father. Is it just not to mention the low social civilization of the United States at the time?
Mrs. Lincoln’s portrayal is very hard, but it’s far from the true biography. It’s still a bit pale, just using some assessments (which are hard to be considered as evaluations) to describe the woman behind a successful man. Is the contrast on the ground to illustrate Lincoln's greatness? Isn’t the Chinese’s “cultivating Qi Zhiping” not universally applicable? At least I don't think that a person who is so dissonant in a family will have much success. To bear so much suffering can still be a national hero.
Have time to look at Lincoln written by others and see if his old man lives in a deep life, often tears and face immortality?</text_trans></item>

<summary>挺有收获</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>当时买这本书是因为看到网上的销售还不错，又比较便宜。现在已经看完了，觉得内容还是不错的，多少有些收获。本书以群体作为研究对象，探讨群体的心理。现在回想一下，古斯塔夫·勒庞所描述的群体是低智商的，冲动的，偏执的，善变的，感情用事而容易受到控制的。在群体之中，人们的原始本能与冲动得到发泄，他们有时显得正义凛然，为了公众的利益而奋不顾身，有时却又十分地残忍粗暴，滥杀无辜，毫无同情心。总之，是喜欢走极端。作者举了一些历史上的例子，让人看了都觉得不可思议，不禁要问，为何人们会有如此缺乏理性的行为？
  从本书的整体看来，第一卷是对群体心理特征的描述，第二卷则重点阐明了应如何来影响群体，在群体活动中取得胜利。他举出了一些影响群体意见的因素，比如：形象事物，群体比较容易受到形象之物的触动；又如词语和套话，群体容易受到词语和套话的影响，你若用一些铿锵有力、言之凿凿的话来打动群众，可能更有效果。若是用说理的方式，群众可能就不买账了；再比如：领袖的声望，人们总是相信权威，容易受到名声的影响，领袖可以较为轻易地带动群众。通过这些因素，可以得到一些方法。比如，当我们在参加演讲比赛时，应当如何表现才能虏获观众的心呢？或许可以从作者的论断中受到启发。
  第三卷主要讲群体的分类及其特点。作者首先将群体分为两大类，一类是异质性群体，另一类是同质性群体。这是根据群体的成员性质来划分的。比如，在大街上因为某件突发的事情而集中起来的群体就是异质性群体，因为他们身份不同，职业不同，宗教不同等等。总之是十分混杂的。而同一个宗教派别的人，他们就是同质性群体，虽然他们可能有不同的职业，不同的文化素养，不同的社会地位，但在宗教派别这一点上，他们是有很强的统一性的。
  再接下来，作者又对群体进行了更细的分类。比如作者描述的：犯罪群体，陪审团群体，选民群体，议会等。这些群体同样具有着第一卷中所阐述的群体的特点，也即缺乏理性和冲动。但是，作者又强调，像陪审团体，选民群体等此类群体是必不可少的。事实上，他们代表了一种力量，与其他的力量相作用共同实现了社会上的平衡制约。
  本书的内容大体就是如此了，虽然作者有些观点我并不同意，但是至少看了本书，在某种程度上拓宽了自己的思路。</text>

<summary_trans>Very rewarding</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought this book because I saw that the online sales were good and cheap. Now that I have finished reading it, I feel that the content is still good and somewhat rewarding. This book uses groups as research objects to explore group psychology. Looking back now, the group described by Gustav Le Pen is low-intelligence, impulsive, paranoid, fickle, and emotionally controlled. Among the groups, people's original instincts and impulses are vented. They sometimes appear to be just and stunned, for the benefit of the public, and sometimes they are cruel and rude, indiscriminate and incompetent. In short, I like to go to extremes. The author cites some historical examples, which make people feel incredible. They can't help but ask why people have such irrational behaviors.
  From the overall perspective of the book, the first volume is a description of the group's psychological characteristics, and the second volume focuses on how to influence the group and win in group activities. He cited some factors that affect the opinions of the group, such as: image things, groups are more susceptible to the touch of images; and words and phrases, groups are susceptible to words and phrases, if you use some powerful, words If you cut the words to impress the masses, it may be more effective. If it is in a reasonable way, the masses may not buy it; for another example: the prestige of the leader, people always believe in authority, and are easily influenced by fame, and leaders can easily drive the masses. Through these factors, some methods can be obtained. For example, when we participate in a speech contest, how should we behave in order to capture the hearts of the audience? Perhaps it can be inspired by the author's argument.
  The third volume focuses on the classification and characteristics of the group. The author first divides the group into two categories, one is a heterogeneous group and the other is a homogenous group. This is based on the nature of the members of the group. For example, groups that are concentrated on the street because of a sudden incident are heterogeneous groups because they have different identities, different occupations, different religions, and so on. In short, it is very mixed. The same religious faction, they are homogenous groups, although they may have different occupations, different cultural qualities, different social status, but in terms of religious factions, they have a strong unity. .
  Next, the authors have a more detailed classification of the group. For example, the author describes: criminal groups, jury groups, elector groups, parliaments, etc. These groups also have the characteristics of the groups described in the first volume, namely the lack of rationality and impulsiveness. However, the author also emphasizes that such groups as jury groups, voters, etc. are essential. In fact, they represent a kind of power that works together with other forces to achieve social balance.
  The content of this book is generally the same, although the author does not agree with some opinions, but at least read the book, to some extent broaden his own ideas.</text_trans></item>

<summary>书有破损，对现在的亚马逊真的又爱又恨，又有些无语</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>预定的书，15号发的货，正常的话17号到，但是因为下雪，又拖了两天今天送过来，当然这不能怪亚马逊，我也是很客气的跟配送员说辛苦了慢走，心怀满满的打开书，看到右下角书角有被撞过的痕迹，几百页都有折痕，后面封皮的折痕是没法修复的，这不知道是第几次在亚马逊买书遇到这样的问题了，以前为了不让书品相受损会稍带买点食品之类的，保证亚马逊能给纸箱包装，但是只要是只买书就只剩一个可怜巴巴的袋子了，而且这次是预购的，单独发货的，所以很显然跟以前一样……
以前遇到这样的问题我会果断退换货的，但一来这几天就不能读了，二来亚马逊的退款拖得时间比较长，换货也是一样的包装，同样不能保证书是完好的，实在是累人，而且前段时间有新闻说，这些大的电商退换货过多会被认为恶意购买而被封号，想想一年在这里购物成千上万，退货也着实不少，有些后怕。这个订单我用了四块五的礼品卡，而且现在换货要5——7天才能发货（柴老的书好看很畅销的缘故吧），所以心想也就只能算了，让我看到书就想到亚马逊的服务吧（不是服务的问题，只是不重视）。
平常都是对朋友和周围的同事说亚马逊有多么多么好，但是心里其实是很复杂的，亚马逊的不好我只跟你们说过。是的，那些批评我的朋友，你说的没错，书是用来读的，但是亚马逊，我们为什么坚持买书看而不去看免费的电子书？亚马逊，您能体谅一下爱书人的心情吗？</text>

<summary_trans>The book is broken, I really love and hate the Amazon now, and I’m speechless.</summary_trans><text_trans>The book booked, the goods sent on the 15th, the normal words arrived on the 17th, but because of the snow, and dragged it for two days today, of course, this can not blame Amazon, I am also very polite to talk to the delivery staff, hard to go, I opened the book with full heart and saw the traces of the corner of the book in the lower right corner. There were creases on hundreds of pages. The creases on the back cover could not be repaired. I don’t know how many times I bought a book in Amazon. In order to avoid such problems, I would like to buy some food in order to prevent the damage of the book, so that Amazon can pack the carton, but as long as it is only a book, there is only one pitiful bag left, and this time it is pre-order. , shipped separately, so it is obviously the same as before...
I have decided to return the goods in the past, but I can't read them in the past few days. Secondly, Amazon's refunds are delayed for a long time. The replacement is also the same packaging. The same is not guaranteed. It’s really tiring, and some news from the previous time said that these large e-commerce returning goods will be considered as malicious purchases and will be sealed. Think about thousands of shopping here in a year, and the return is also quite a lot, some fear . I used four or five gift cards for this order, and now I have to exchange the goods for 5-7 days (the old book is very popular), so I can only think about it, let me When you read the book, you think of Amazon's service (not the problem of service, just not paying attention).
I usually say how good Amazon is to my friends and colleagues around me, but my heart is actually very complicated. I am only told you about Amazon. Yes, those who criticize me, you are right, the book is for reading, but Amazon, why do we insist on buying books instead of watching free e-books? Amazon, can you understand the mood of a book-lover?</text_trans></item>

<summary>慧海一滴</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>宗萨钦哲仁波切无论怎样谦虚的描述他自己的修行和内证，但对我和很多人来讲，他就是文殊菩萨的真实化现。传统意义上来讲，前行比起佛法的经论闻思修多了不少所谓的宗教色彩，比如皈依，磕头，念咒，献供等等。但是他却能够让没有宗教信仰甚至对宗教特色持反感态度的人了解这些最具有所谓宗教色彩的内容原来并非以前所想象的那样。
  对已经接收或者皈依佛法的人来说，仁波切的开示也可谓智慧甘露。就像他在之前的著作里面所说的那样，也许他并不能告诉我们什么是绝对正确的，但起码能让我们了知什么是错误的。目前太多人所谓的修行都充满了太多的想当然和自由发挥，通过这本书书，也许我们能够更好的理解这些看似程式化的修行所代表的到底什么是什么。</text>

<summary_trans>Huihai one drop</summary_trans><text_trans>Zongsa Khyentse Rinpoche described his own practice and internal evidence in a humble way, but for me and many people, he is the realization of Manjushri. Traditionally, there are many so-called religious colors, such as conversion, gimmicks, chanting, offerings, etc., compared to the Buddhist studies. But he is able to let people who are not religious or even resentful about religious characteristics understand that the most so-called religious colors are not what they were supposed to be.
  For those who have received or converted to Dharma, Rinpoche’s presentation can also be described as wisdom and dew. As he said in his previous work, perhaps he can't tell us what is absolutely correct, but at least it allows us to know what is wrong. At present, too many people's so-called practice is full of too many thoughts and freedom to play. Through this book, perhaps we can better understand what these seemingly stylized practices represent.</text_trans></item>

<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>最近突发皮肤病，在手臂还有腰侧。妈妈说外表看起来有点像“蛇”（带状疱疹，中医叫缠腰火丹，潮语称“蛇”），但我又感觉不像，因为没有疼痛感。到华侨医院给皮肤科看了一下，说是给虫咬了，配了药回家涂抹，谁知道一点效果都没有，还更严重了。于是买了这本书自己看一看。可是收到书时，皮肤已经好了很多了，老妈子给我开了一些中药，还自制了一些涂抹的药水。我手臂的就抹华侨医院医生开的药水，腰部就抹老妈子自制的中药水（因为老妈的专业是中医儿科，不是皮肤科，我也有点信不过她，嘻嘻），两者分别使用，看看效果有啥不同。但我想，还是自己能弄最好。
这年头，老百姓看不起病，也没啥办法，只能自己学点医学知识对付对付小病了。
言归正传，还是说说这本书吧。
内容，医学不是我的专业，内容不好评论，总体感觉不错，至少比家里母亲的中医书容易懂。
纸张，很好，滑滑的，像那种杂志的铜版纸，但比较薄。
印刷，那个好啊，是我见过的做得最好的医学教科书了，图片特别清晰。全书是彩图印刷的，刚开始看时不像的在看教材，倒是有点是在看杂志，呵呵。
厚度，没有卓越说的2厘米厚，1厘米都还不到。
值得表扬的是，基本上每一种病都有图片，这样可以做到图文对照。
光盘里是一本电子书，文字内容极其简单，就是几个小标题和要点，下面是每一种病的图片，图片比较多。全盘大概280M左右。感觉用处不是很大。
以上就是我的评论，不知道对你是否有用？如果感觉对你有帮助，请点下面，支持一下，算是对小弟辛苦打字的鼓励吧，哈哈。</text>

<summary_trans>Excellent introduction is too simple, let me add</summary_trans><text_trans>Recently a sudden skin disease, in the arm and waist side. Mom said that the appearance looks a bit like a "snake" (shingles, Chinese medicine is called a shackle, and the tide is called "snake"), but I don't feel like it because there is no pain. I went to the Overseas Chinese Hospital and looked at the dermatology department. I said that it was bitten by the insects. I used the medicine to smear it. Who knows that there is no effect at all, and it is even more serious. So I bought this book and took a look at it. However, when I received the book, the skin was much better. The old mother gave me some Chinese medicine and made some smeared potions. My arm will wipe the medicinal medicine opened by the doctor of Huaqiao Hospital, and the waist will wipe the old Chinese medicine water (because the mother's specialty is Chinese medicine pediatrics, not dermatology, I also believe a little about her, 嘻嘻), use the two separately, see See the effect is different. But I think, I can still get the best.
This year, the people do not look down on the disease, and there is no way to learn the medical knowledge to deal with minor illnesses.
Closer to home, or talk about this book.
Content, medicine is not my profession, the content is not good, the overall feeling is good, at least better than the mother's Chinese medicine book.
Paper, very good, slippery, like the magazine's coated paper, but thinner.
Printing, that's good, it's the best medical textbook I've ever seen, and the picture is especially clear. The whole book is printed in color pictures. When I first started watching it, I didn’t look at the textbooks. It was a bit of reading magazines, huh, huh.
The thickness is not as good as 2 cm thick, and 1 cm is not enough.
It is worthy of praise that basically every disease has a picture, so that you can do graphic comparison.
The CD is an e-book. The text is extremely simple. It is just a few subtitles and main points. Below is a picture of each disease. There are many pictures. The whole plate is about 280M. I feel that it is not very useful.
The above is my comment. I don't know if it is useful to you? If you feel helpful to you, please click below, support, it is an encouragement for the younger brother to type, haha.</text_trans></item>

<summary>好书！看完发言！！</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>嗯～ 读完了觉得是本好书，虽然听起来标题觉得很偏激，但是看过之后觉得道理说的很中肯。追求人生成长和幸福的女孩子可以看看哦～ 很多中国现在正在经历的社会问题和两性问题都作了阐述。说到底，要一个男人真正爱你，你得先付出努力的去成长，去爱自己。鼓励更多的人去读。还没读完这本书，就事先把很多偏见加上去，去批判，去自行揣测，可能会有失偏颇吧。你没读完怎么知道作者想说什么，为什么，哪个角度考虑的问题。我个人觉得陈愉说得挺对的。当然观点问题，见仁见智，但是最好是看完书在形成意见。</text>

<summary_trans>Good book! Read the speech! !</summary_trans><text_trans>Um~ After reading it, I think it is a good book. Although it sounds very biased, I feel that it is very pertinent after reading it. Girls who pursue life growth and happiness can look at it. Many social problems and gender issues that China is currently experiencing are elaborated. After all, to have a man truly love you, you have to work hard to grow and love yourself. Encourage more people to read. If you haven't finished reading this book, you will add a lot of prejudice in advance, criticize it, and make your own guesses. It may be biased. If you haven't finished reading, how do you know what the author wants to say, why, and which angle to consider. I personally think that Chen Yu is quite right. Of course, the point of view is a matter of opinion, but it is best to form an opinion after reading the book.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Too popular, so no nutrition</summary_trans><text_trans>It may be that my expectations are too high. The book is divided into four kinds of characters. Then there are a few old stories that are often talked about. There is no interest in reading. According to personality color, it is estimated that it is not as specific as the constellation. Of course, the book's paper is good, very colorful, and that's it. "Editor's recommendation: Who am I? Why do I become what I am now?" These are the reasons why I bought books. Why don't you sell cut cakes? I really like the performance of the music master, so I give one more star.</text_trans></item>

<text>1刚拿到货回来验货看到封面边缘有明显锯齿感
2打开后发现纸张偏黄，偏薄，本来也没觉着什么，薄点就薄点吧，但是！！！！
我真伤心了也就是第三点
3印刷的字体用手轻微一抹，居然花了？？？花了啊亲，你是刚印的吗？刚从打印室出炉的就跟你这一样啊，不过人家纸张比还你好
综上，亲们，我就不建议你们买了</text>

<summary_trans>It’s good to have been shopping at Amazon, but this time I really feel like buying pirated copies.</summary_trans><text_trans>1 I just got the goods back and checked the goods and saw a sharp jaggedness on the edge of the cover.
2 After opening, I found that the paper was yellowish and thin, and I didn’t feel anything at all. Thin points were thin, but! ! ! !
I am really sad, that is the third point.
3 printed fonts with a slight touch of hand, actually spent? ? ? It took a long time, are you just printed? Just getting out of the print room is just like you, but people are better than paper.

<summary>难过，非常的……</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>本来很期待的，但是看到书的时候很难过啊很郁闷啊，
尤其是在翻过几页之后就更是难过了，
内容完全不像西方人的想法，一查果然……
我想买的是卡耐基原著“写给女人一生幸福的忠告”，
但是没有想到一时冲动之下竟然犯了个不小心仔细检查的错误，
再仔细看过书页前面的标版次什么的那页才发现作者根本不是“卡耐基”，而是“韦秀英”，
连书内封页上都写原著是“卡耐基”，编译者是“韦秀英”，这不是完全不一样的吗？
编译并不是著作的意思吧！！！！
不是我说什么，这种东西应该标清楚吧，
在网页上也写说原著作者是“卡耐基”，根本就没有怀疑，直接买下。
这跟超市东西包装和内部的东西不一样，伪价钱的事件有什么区别啊？！
跟另外一本卡耐基原著“写给女人一生幸福的忠告”对照，
差十万八千里啊！！！！！
本来想退货的，不过想就觉得麻烦，就算自己吃个闷亏好了，
第一次在卓越上买书就遇到这样的状况真的让我很郁闷。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Sad, very...</summary_trans><text_trans>I was very looking forward to it, but it was very sad when I saw the book. It was very depressed.
Especially after turning a few pages, it is even more sad.
The content is completely different from the ideas of Westerners.
What I want to buy is Carnegie's original book "Writing to a woman's life's happiness."
However, I did not expect that I was mistakenly examined by impulsiveness.
After carefully reading the page in front of the page, I found that the author was not "Carnegie" at all, but "Wei Xiuying".
Even the original book on the cover page is "Carnegie", the compiler is "Wei Xiuying", is this not completely different?
Compiling is not the meaning of writing! ! ! !
Not what I said, this kind of thing should be clearly marked,
I also wrote on the website that the original author was "Carnegie", and there was no doubt at all. I bought it directly.
This is different from the supermarket packaging and the internal things. What is the difference between the fake price events? !
Contrast with another original Carnegie book, "Write a woman's life's good advice."
It’s a hundred thousand miles! ! ! ! !
I originally wanted to return the goods, but I thought I was in trouble, even if I had a boring loss,
It was really frustrating for me to encounter such a situation when I first bought a book on excellence.</text_trans></item>

<summary>大陆赛斯第一弹！</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这本书是中国大陆出版的第一本完全介绍赛斯思想的参考资料，虽然不是珍的赛斯书，但是对赛斯爱好者来说也是个极大的福音！赛斯书内容很艰深，这本书节选了赛斯书的片段，作者也做了很多解释，但是也不是很好理解，也需要下一番功夫。对于不想深入了解赛斯思想的读者来讲，我觉得这本书基本上已经足够作为完整的参考。
书中的练习都很有价值，慢慢做来，相信会很有收获。译文的质量不错，是比较用心的。
最后还是期望大陆早日出版赛斯书的中译本。</text>

<summary_trans>The first hit of the mainland Seth!</summary_trans><text_trans>This book is the first reference material published in mainland China to fully introduce Seth's thoughts. Although it is not a rare Seth book, it is also a great gospel for Seth lovers! The content of the Seth book is very difficult. This book excerpts the fragments of the Seth book. The author also made a lot of explanations, but it is not well understood and it takes a lot of effort. For readers who don't want to know more about Seth's thoughts, I think this book is basically enough for a complete reference.
The exercises in the book are very valuable. If you do it slowly, I believe it will be very rewarding. The quality of the translation is good and it is more attentive.
Finally, I hope that the mainland will publish the Chinese translation of the Seth book as soon as possible.</text_trans></item>

<text>拿到书，第一时间就赶紧拜读，失望之极。
名不副实，并没有告诉制作者如何去说服看PPT的人。
如果你做的PPT很烂，你看完这本书也抓不住重点。这本书还好意思说是用ppt来写书，排版很乱，本身就是反面教材。
如果你PPT做的还不错，多看点好的PPT比这本书来得实在，我觉得从中获得不了多少营养。书中距的例子根本就没有融入感。一共6章，前三章大谈菜鸟和高手的区别，第4帐还没说啥东西就结束了，第56章就完全是贴ppt的一些图标和菜单讲解。
如果你是高手，那就更不用看了。
这种书看完，你会觉得它说得的确没错，但都是废话。</text>

<summary_trans>Not worth buying, it is better to go to see a few good speech demonstrations</summary_trans><text_trans>When I got the book, I quickly read it, and I was very disappointed.
The name is not true, and did not tell the producer how to convince people to see PPT.
If you do a bad PPT, you can't grasp the point after reading this book. This book is also very interesting to say that it is to use ppt to write books, the layout is very chaotic, it is the opposite of the textbook.
If your PPT is doing well, it's better to see more good PPT than this book. I don't think much nutrients can be obtained from it. The example of the book's distance is simply not integrated. A total of six chapters, the first three chapters talk about the difference between rookie and master, the fourth account has not said that the end of the matter, the 56th chapter is completely ppt some icons and menus.
If you are a master, you don't have to look at it.
After reading this book, you will feel that it is true, but it is nonsense.</text_trans></item>

There is such a sentence in the book that reflects Maugham's ideal: "A person becomes pure and perfect, and his character will have a wide-ranging influence. So that those who pursue the truth will naturally approach him." Unfortunately, I can't read the original, but now it is also very good.</text_trans></item>

<text>孙老师的理念我一直非常赞成，但是总觉得在中国实行起来难度大。最近又看了一本《输在起跑线上的哈佛男孩》，特别佩服这个爸爸、妈妈，他们当初一定还没有看孙老师的书，却非常勇敢的实施了这种理念。他们的孩子转学的时候即使留一级学校还不肯收留，最后给校长送了礼才肯收。这样一个差的不能再差的差生，就靠爱和自由，靠21项软实力，和自己挖掘出的最佳匹配，考上了优等生都不敢想的哈佛商学院，看似奇迹的背后有的是家长的与众不同的智慧。看了这本书后更加坚信孙老师的理念，每当我在实行孙老师的理念有顾虑的时候，就翻阅《输在起跑线上的哈佛男孩》，那些软实力，最佳匹配。。。。让我清楚的知道，具体的实施步骤，一步一步，一定能成功。爱和自由，还有软实力和最佳匹配，祝天下所有孩子都能成功</text>

<summary_trans>Mr. Sun provided the idea, and the Harvard boy who lost on the starting line provided a case.</summary_trans><text_trans>I have always been very supportive of Sun’s philosophy, but I always feel that it is difficult to implement in China. I recently watched a copy of "Harvard Boys Lost at the Starting Line", especially admire this father and mother. They must have not read Sun's book before, but they have bravely implemented this concept. When their children transfer to school, they will not accept it even if they stay in the first-grade school. Finally, they will be rewarded with the gift of the principal. Such a poor and inferior student, relying on love and freedom, relying on 21 soft powers, and the best match that he has unearthed, was admitted to Harvard Business School, which is not daunted by top students, seemingly behind the miracle. Some are parents' distinctive wisdom. After reading this book, I am more convinced of Sun's philosophy. Whenever I have concerns about implementing Sun's philosophy, I will read "Harvard Boys Lost at the Starting Line", those soft powers, the best match. . . . Let me know clearly that the specific implementation steps, step by step, will be successful. Love and freedom, as well as soft power and best match, I wish all children in the world can succeed</text_trans></item>

<summary>过来人对我们浮躁的年轻人的教诲。。。</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>花了两天时间将这本书看完了，感觉很不错，现在的社会是一个浮躁的社会，而本人也是一个浮躁的80后。看这本书的时候，我是一边拿着铅笔勾画一边反思的。
冯仑是我早已熟知的一位商人，为什么说是商人，应为对他了解不多。但是通过这本书，让我了解了藏在商人背影后另一个冯仑。名人传记和书籍看过不少，大部分都是端着架子讲大道理的居多，很难得有人放下架子告诉你：不要着急买房、放飞自己、找到自己想做的事情、跳出体系外等等。很不错，感触也很深。引人深思！
我这几天也一直在反思，为什么？
为什么我会买了一堆书，像叫馒头一样去看？
为什么刚有点钱便要去买房然后自己深陷银行的陷阱里面？
为什么会要求自己在半年时间内（无法完成的时间内）读完《资治通鉴》？
为什么每个几个月又对新的东西产生兴趣，而原来的想了解的方面一知半解的时候放弃？
为什么干一个工作老是想着一有跳板马上就去挑战？
为什么自己会越来越不开心？越来越难以完整的看完一部书、一套书、一部长篇小说？
为什么现在懒得连一片文章都不写？
很多的思考早脑海里蹦出来，究其原因，我们这代人都抱着出名要乘早的心态，浮躁的活在这个浮躁的社会上。我们太不能熬了，读了冯仑的书，才知道伟大有时候是真的靠熬出来的。熬是一种智慧，也是一种锻炼。年轻人少了这种锻炼便会缺少平和、大气。。。。
书评分没给满分，是由于部分章节是冯仑在给自己的公司和产品做广告，“立体城市”。但又没有4.5分。所以只能给了4分。
不过总体来说是本好书，值得大家阅读。。。</text>

<summary_trans>People come to teach us about our impetuous young people. . .</summary_trans><text_trans>After spending two days reading the book, I feel very good. The current society is an impetuous society, and I am also an impetuous 80. When I read this book, I reflected it while holding a pencil sketch.
Feng Lun is a businessman I already know well. Why is it a businessman? I don’t know much about him. But through this book, let me know another Feng Lun hidden behind the businessman's back. Celebrity biographies and books have been seen a lot, most of them are mostly on the shelf, it is difficult to have someone put down the shelf to tell you: don't worry about buying a house, flying yourself, finding what you want to do, jumping out of the system and so on. Very good, and the feeling is very deep. Thoughtful!
I have been reflecting on these days, why?
Why do I buy a bunch of books and look like a hoe?
Why do you have to buy a house just after a little money and then fall into the trap of the bank yourself?
Why do you ask yourself to read the Zizhitongjian within half a year (unable to complete)?
Why do you have an interest in new things every few months, and give up when you want to understand the original aspects?
Why do you always work to challenge when you have a springboard?
Why are you getting more and more unhappy? It is increasingly difficult to read a book, a set of books, and a novel in a complete picture.
Why are you too lazy to write even an article?
A lot of thinking came out in the early mind, the reason is that our generation is holding a name to take advantage of the early mentality, floating in this impetuous society. We can't be too embarrassed. After reading Feng Lun's book, I realized that greatness is sometimes really relied on. Jealousy is a kind of wisdom and an exercise. Young people who lack this exercise will lack peace and atmosphere. . . .
The book score did not give full marks, because some chapters are Feng Lun advertising his company and products, "three-dimensional city." But there is no 4.5 points. So I can only give 4 points.
But overall it is a good book, worth reading. . .</text_trans></item>

<summary>能读到这本书是福气，也是幸运</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这本书是我近年来读到的最好的一本谈中国家庭教育的书，几乎每篇文章都会给我一个启示。比如原来看的家教书也说过孩子碰到桌子上不要打桌子，但只是说到这里，我也只是不打而已。但这一本书却进一步给出办法，孩子如果被小板凳碰着了，要给小板凳揉揉痛，这一下就让我觉得真是棋高一着。一个小细节，拨开迷雾。原来也看了很多书说不要要求孩子考100分，我知道这个道理是对的，但却不知道如果不要求孩子的分数，如何能保证他的成绩。这本书教给我非常有用的一招，就是用“事后打100分”的办法，这个办法简直是太有效了。原来我天天要检查孩子的作来，总怪孩子粗心大意，自从看了“不陪”那篇文章，不检查了，我发现他作业上的错误倒反而少了。
还有孩子吃饭的问题，这是最让我解放的一个收获，原来也象书中那个专家奶奶似地，下了很多功夫，但孩子吃饭一直不好。看了书上的这篇文章，按书中给出的几条原则来做，真是见效，孩子吃饭越来越好，我也越来越轻松了。
我对这本书的感觉就是相见恨晚，如果能早些看到，我会少走许多弯路，不过好在现在看到了，也不算晚，孩子刚上小学，一切都来得及。真是太幸运了，我觉得这是我和儿子的福气，也是我们的运气。建议所有的妈妈都看看，真的是不一样的收获。</text>

<summary_trans>It is a blessing and a fortune to read this book.</summary_trans><text_trans>This book is the best book I have ever read about Chinese family education in recent years. Almost every article will give me a revelation. For example, the original tutor book also said that children should not hit the table when they touch the table, but just said that I am just not playing. But this book has further given a way. If the child is touched by a small bench, it will give pain to the small bench. This makes me feel that it is really high. A small detail, set aside the fog. I also read a lot of books saying that I don't ask my children to take 100 points. I know that this is correct, but I don't know how to guarantee his score if I don't ask for the child's score. This book teaches me a very useful trick, which is to use the "100 points afterwards" approach, which is simply too effective. It turns out that I have to check the children's work every day. I always blame the child for being careless. Since I read the article "I don't accompany", I didn't check it. I found that the mistakes in his homework were less.
There are also problems with children eating. This is the most liberating thing for me. It turned out to be a lot of hard work like the expert grandmother in the book, but the children have not been eating well. After reading this article in the book, according to the principles given in the book, it is really effective. The children are getting better and better, and I am getting more and more relaxed.
My feeling for this book is that I am late to see each other. If I can see it earlier, I will take a lot of detours, but it is not too late to see it now. The child just went to elementary school and everything is too late. It’s so lucky, I think this is the blessing of my son and my luck. It is recommended that all mothers have a look, it is really a different harvest.</text_trans></item>

<text>本来满心欢喜的买了这本书，收到之后，打开来读，才发现，完全是鸡肋。
打分的时候也是犹豫不决，其实想给一分的。
先来说说诗歌新译吧。怎么说呢，这个译本，真的是我见到的我最不满意的。完全是一种新诗的格式，和以前曾缄等人的译本比起来差太多了。这个译本的文采一般，写出来给我的感觉是矫情。唯一一点值得安慰的就是收录了曾缄的译作，不然可看性就太一般了。因为他收录了曾缄的译本，所以给他一颗星。
第二，书的装帧设计很考究，另外，本书的最后一部分关于仓央嘉措诗歌及译本的讨论算是本书的第二个亮点。
综合上述原因，我只能说这本书很普通，最起码是我买的所有译本里最不好的一个版本。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Very general book</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought this book with great joy. After I received it, I opened it and read it. I discovered that it was completely chicken.
When I scored, I was hesitant. I really wanted to give a point.
Let me talk about the new translation of poetry. How to say it, this translation is really the most dissatisfied I have seen. It is completely a new poetry format, which is much worse than the previous translations of Zeng Yi and others. The literary style of this translation is general, and the feeling that is written to me is sentimental. The only thing that deserves to be comforted is the inclusion of Zeng’s translation, otherwise the visibility is too general. Because he included the translation of Zeng Wei, give him a star.
Second, the book's binding design is very elegant. In addition, the last part of the book about the discussion of the poems and translations of Tsangyang Gyatso is the second highlight of the book.
For the above reasons, I can only say that this book is very common, at least the worst version of all the translations I bought.</text_trans></item>

<text>碰到给力促销时囤下的货。
刚开始看，觉得故事内容平淡无奇，讲述一个十来岁女孩子每天经历的日常琐事。读到最后，真相大白时，才觉得恍然大悟，回味无穷。
对于不到4岁的女儿来说，这样的书，只能留着慢慢长大后才能理解。但对于大人而言，也是一本不错的读本。</text>

<summary>让我失望到想要退货的书</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>我拿到书的时候很开心，当时看到的各种评论和各种推荐都写得很好，让我认为这是一本值得一读的好书。然而当我抱着虔诚的态度打开书的时候，我真的失望极了。我不能理解一本满是众所周知的大道理加上一些与我而言遥不可及的故事，为何会能给人带来收获。第一章在说“心”的强大，说我们的内心强大，我们的拥有积极的心态我们就能解决所有的困难。我想大家都知道积极心态面对这个世界当然比消极强，当然能够令人变得自信成功的概率也就大一些。可是我不觉得看到了这本书我有更加深刻的认识。第二章在说我们需要一个目标，这也是一个大家都知道的事情吧。有目标我们才有前进的方向以及动力，才能走对前进的路。我看过这本书之后我也没能找到我自己的目标。
  这本书里面的实例都太遥远太遥远了，我估计坐上飞机也追赶不到。这样子的实例跟本不能让我产生共鸣，更加不能让我学到什么，富兰克林、爱迪生……这些真的有够遥远的。我不再多说什么，我真的很想退货。</text>

<summary_trans>Let me down to the book I want to return</summary_trans><text_trans>I was very happy when I got the book. The various comments and recommendations I saw at the time were well written, and I thought it was a good book worth reading. However, when I opened the book with a sincere attitude, I was really disappointed. I can't understand a story that is full of well-known and some stories that are far away from me. Why can it bring benefits? The first chapter is about the power of "heart", saying that our heart is strong, and we have a positive attitude that we can solve all the difficulties. I think everyone knows that a positive attitude is certainly stronger than negative in the face of the world. Of course, the probability of becoming confident and successful is greater. But I don't think I have a deeper understanding of this book. The second chapter is saying that we need a goal. This is also a thing that everyone knows. With the goal, we have the direction and motivation to move forward. I have not found my own goal after reading this book.
  The examples in this book are too far away, and I guess I can't catch up on the plane. This kind of example can't make me resonate, and I can't let me learn anything. Franklin, Edison... These are really far away. I don't say anything more, I really want to return it.</text_trans></item>

<summary>好玩的小学一年级生活</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>　　有了孩子之后开始我喜欢阅读童书，不仅是因为孩子的关系而扩大了阅读偏好，私底下更是存在一个想法，那就是——通过自己先期阅读，先期对童书进行甄选，这样孩子在不同年龄阶段、不同阅读能力和水平下阅读童书时，我便能够将最优秀的、最适合他的书推荐给他，所以，我阅读童书有娱乐自己和为孩子阅读把关这两个目的及双重效果。
　　
　　我的孩子还要再过好几年才能读小学一年级，但是我已经迫不及待想了解一年级小淘气们的快乐生活了，因为这本《小淘气快乐日记：一年级真好玩》如书名所标榜的那样，确实很好玩，很可爱。
　　
　　小淘气快乐日记由曾经是一名小学一年级老师的狐狸姐姐所执笔，日记取材于一年级孩子们的日常学生生活。在狐狸姐姐的妙笔下，这些在学校里发生的一年级学生的平常事变得那样趣味盎然、充满童真。日记中，狐狸姐姐化身为美羊羊老师，老师带领着外表特征各异、性格禀赋不同的一年级学生，他们分别是——主人公黄瓜瓜，他的同学牛笑笑、郑大牛、馒头、宝蛋、李小丫、大熊等。
　　
　　睿智的美羊羊老师讲了一个自己小时候尿床的善意谎话故事，巧妙地化解了黄瓜瓜尿裤子这一些尴尬难堪的事实。在老师自己公布的“糗事”下，孩子不仅得到老师的尊重，更从老师那里获得同理心与感同身受的理解，原来老师是个尿床精啊~如此，便不再觉得尿裤子是丢人现眼的大丑事。
　　
　　智慧的老师，可爱的学生，构成了一副副一年级学生校园生活的快乐画面。这样快乐的校园生活让我不禁努力回想自己当年的小学一年级生活，无奈，年月太久，记忆早已模糊不堪，完全回忆不出三十多年前的一年级学校生活，只是很肯定当年我也如小淘气快乐日记中各位同学一样，过得无忧无虑，纯真快乐。
　　
　　抛开成人的视角，如果是一个即将就读小学的孩子来阅读这本书，我想孩子也一定会被这样充满快乐的一年级生活所吸引，迫不及待得想入读小学吧。而且，书中清晰大号的字体，每个汉字上的拼音标注，都非常适合孩子，适合孩子自主阅读。
　　
　　另外，日记体裁的写作方式，可以引导孩子更好地写日记，可以引导孩子对写日记产生兴趣。

<summary_trans>Fun primary school first grade life</summary_trans><text_trans>After I have children, I like to read children's books, not only because of the children's relationship, but also because of the expansion of reading preferences. In private, there is an idea that – through their own reading, the children’s books will be selected in advance, so that the children are When I read children's books at different ages, reading abilities and levels, I was able to recommend the best books that best suit him. Therefore, I read the children's books to entertain themselves and read them for children. And double effect.

My child will have to wait a few more years to go to the first grade of elementary school, but I can't wait to understand the happy life of the first-year naughty, because this book "Little Naughty Happy Diary: First Grade is really fun" is advertised as the title of the book. That's really fun, very cute.

The little naughty happy diary is written by the fox sister who used to be a first-grade elementary school teacher. The diary is based on the daily student life of the first-grade children. Under the singularity of the fox sister, the ordinary things of the first-year students who happened in the school became so interesting and full of innocence. In the diary, the fox sister is transformed into a beautiful sheep teacher. The teacher leads the first-grade students with different characteristics and different personality traits. They are the main character, cucumber melon, his classmates Niu Xiaoxiao, Zheng Daniu, Shantou, Bao egg. Li Xiaolu, Big Bear, etc.

The wise Mei Yang teacher told a story of a good faith lie in bed when he was a child, cleverly dispelling the embarrassing facts of cucumber melon pants. Under the teacher's own anecdote, the child not only received the respect of the teacher, but also gained empathy and empathy from the teacher. The teacher was a bed-wetting master. So, no longer feel that the diaper is a shameful scandal.

The wise teacher and the lovely student constitute a happy picture of the deputy first-year student's campus life. This happy campus life makes me unable to work hard to think back to my first year of primary school life. I have no choice but to live for too long. The memory is already vague. I can’t recall the first-year school life more than 30 years ago. I’m sure I was Like the students in the small naughty happy diary, they are carefree and innocent.

Aside from the adult perspective, if a child who is going to elementary school is reading this book, I think the child will be attracted to such a happy first-grade life, and can't wait to enter elementary school. Moreover, the clear large font in the book, the pinyin label on each Chinese character, is very suitable for children, suitable for children to read independently.

In addition, the writing style of the diary genre can guide the child to better write a diary, and can guide the child to have an interest in writing a diary.

<summary>畅销，傻瓜式的忽悠</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>前几天看了《注意力曲线》，因为在这本书的时候看到书评说配合《注意力曲线》看效果更好，结果被忽悠上当，买了这两本书，看完《注意力曲线》觉得就是烂书一本，东坪西凑，错误说教；
 　　
　　这本和《注意力曲线》确实是一个水平，错误，东拼西凑；
　　
　　1：错误，原作的理论表述本来就错误，不严谨，翻译也错误，加在一起在我看来就成了一本胡说八道的书了，真的要理解心理学的内容，还是去看通俗一点的心理学教科书，这样的书现在翻译的也不少了；不要相信什么技巧，诀窍；这些基本就是忽悠；
 　　
　　2：表述泛泛而谈，书总是喜欢用亲身经历，引用一些所谓畅销书的内容来说明理论，而对理论本身的来源和阐述却是稀里糊涂，把科学理论误当成生活工具，而本身连理论是什么都没有说清楚；
 　　
　　3：结构混乱，东拉西扯；如第三章，标题为“大脑部关注无聊之事”，说着又扯到了多任务处理上，基本上每章都是这样的东平西凑，没有系统性，标题很随意，吸引眼球；
　　
　　对这种书没什么耐心了，豆瓣评分还这么高，这样的书60分已经是高看了；
　　
　　可能也过了看这种书的年龄了，如果什么都不懂看这种书还能增加点知识，但是现在看来书中的内容都是错误的，这样的书也只能是误人子弟了。
　　
　　错误是这种书最大的缺点，这种本本身就是个错误。
　　读者明辨吧，出这种书也没人管，科普书连基本的正确性都保证不了，出了有什么意义呢？贻害人间。</text>

<summary_trans>Best-selling, foolish flicker</summary_trans><text_trans>I watched the "Attention Curve" a few days ago, because I saw the book review saying that it worked better with the "Attention Curve" in this book. The result was fooled, bought these two books, and watched the attention. The curve feels like a bad book, Dongping Xiqiao, wrong teaching;
 
This book and the "Attention Curve" are indeed a level, wrong, and patchwork;

1: Error, the theoretical expression of the original is inherently wrong, not rigorous, and the translation is wrong. Together, it seems to me to be a nonsense book. I really want to understand the content of psychology, or go to see popular things. A little psychology textbook, such a book is now translated a lot; don't believe in any skills, oh; these are basically flicker;
 
2: The statement is general. The book always likes to use personal experience, citing the contents of some so-called best-selling books to explain the theory, but the source and explanation of the theory itself is confusing, the scientific theory is mistaken as a tool of life, and the theory itself Nothing is said clearly;
 
3: The structure is confusing, and the east is pulling; as in the third chapter, the title is “The brain is concerned about boring things”, and it is said that it is also multi-tasking. Basically, each chapter is like this, there is no system. Sex, the title is very casual, attracting attention;

I have no patience with this kind of book, and the watercress score is still so high. This book has 60 points already high;

It may have passed the age of reading such a book. If you don’t understand anything, you can add some knowledge. But now it seems that the contents of the book are all wrong. Such a book can only be a mistake. It is.

Errors are the biggest drawback of this book, and this is a mistake in itself.
The reader clearly discerns that there is no such thing as a book. The basic correctness of the popular science book cannot be guaranteed. What is the significance of it? Harmful to the world.</text_trans></item>

However, I saw so many pages that I found out that I still took notes on it, so I didn't want to retire. Here, I just want to remind the publisher, don't be too crowded!</text_trans></item>

<summary>伪命题层出不穷</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>题目“为什么中国人勤劳而不富有”，其实说的是“为什么你勤劳而不富有”？不富有的人多得很，而且谁都认为自己很勤劳，于是乎，这个题目就很容易就抓住了勤劳而不富有的，或“勤劳”而不富有的人们的眼球。待翻开书一看，自然又是“你没错我没错全是社会的错”这老三篇，于是乎，读者获得极大的心理平衡，作者作为读者之一当然也痛快得很。
  至于“什么叫做富有”、“‘中国人勤劳而不富有’这一结论从何而来”、“勤劳和富有之间有什么必然联系吗”之类不讨人喜欢的问题，读者不愿看，作者更不愿写，于是乎，集体忽略之，糊涂是福嘛！
  既然作者如此崇拜西方模式，为什么不花点工夫把学术推论的基本方法搞搞清楚？拿出中学课本来复习一下什么叫充分条件、必要条件和充分必要条件？什么叫做立论、推论和结论？
  卖弄那些似是而非的名词和概念，不是用其来推论真理，而是为自己的断言立证。学术岂容如此践踏！资源如此匮乏的今天，可怜的地球还得为这种浅薄愚昧知识贫乏的伪命题著作买单，真是天道之大不幸！

<summary_trans>Pseudo-propositions are endless</summary_trans><text_trans>The title "Why Chinese people are hardworking and not rich" is actually saying "Why are you hardworking and not rich?" There are many people who are not rich, and everyone thinks that they are hardworking. So, this topic easily captures the eye of people who are hardworking and not rich, or "hardworking" and not wealthy. When I open the book, it is natural that "You are right, I am right, it is all the fault of the society." The old three, so the readers get a great psychological balance. Of course, the author as a reader is also very happy.
  As for the unpleasant question of "what is rich", "what is the conclusion that 'Chinese people are diligent and not rich'", and "what is the inevitable connection between hardworking and wealthy", readers do not want to see The author is even more reluctant to write, so it is, the collective ignores it, and the confusion is a blessing!
  Since the author worships the Western model so much, why not take some time to figure out the basic methods of academic inference? Take out the middle school textbook to review what are the sufficient conditions, necessary conditions and necessary and sufficient conditions? What is theory, inference and conclusion?
  Selling plausible nouns and concepts is not to use them to infer truth, but to prove their own assertions. Academic content is so trampled! Today, when resources are so scarce, the poor earth has to pay for such a shallow, ignorant and knowledge-poor pseudo-proposition book. It is really a big misfortune!

<text>产消合一的魅力——小评《财富的革命》
未来将发生什么的变化，很多人信誓旦旦的预言如此这般，然而可能连现在的变化都未曾了解，现在正在进行着一场财富的变革，引导这次变革的是“冥冥之中”的三个深层原理：空间、时间与知识。《财富的革命》是一本这样的书：巧妙的通过对深层原理的阐释，让深处变革漩涡中的我们更清晰的了解我们生活的世界。
  作者阿尔文·托夫勒夫妇被认为著名的未来学家，他们关于趋势的著作相当有名，更因为《第三次浪潮》该书在国内产生的“浪潮”被我们所熟识。而《财富的革命》正是他们在2006年出版的一本书。书中通过丰富生动、层出不穷的事例向我们阐述着现在发生并将持续发生的财富革命！
  为了揭示财富革命背后的动力，作者将其归纳为三个深层原理：时间、空间与知识。失同步化现象正是时间原理的表现，在社会变革中，企业、教育部门、政府在用不同的速度适应变革，又由于速度的不一致，造成了失去同步的现象；空间的变化主要体现在财富的转移，从一个大洲漂洋过海到另外一个大洲；而最后一点，知识原理，显而易见的，正是第三次浪潮所描述的知识革命。
  深刻理解现在正在进行的变革，理解它在时间、空间与知识上的变化，也因此可以顺势而为。诚然深层原理是这本书的核心，不过我更在意《财富的革命》中提到的产消合一模式。何谓产消合一呢？就字面来解，就是生产者和消费者合二为一。
  银行的自动提款机正是产消合一模式的典型体现。我们“亲自”动手去“为自己”服务，而这项服务本应该是银行职员提供的，我们在使用自动提款机的一刻，成为了一名产消合一者，我们是银行服务的消费者，同时也是部分的生产者。正是由于我们身份由单纯的消费者转变为产消合一者，为银行节约了大量的人力资本，更可贵的时，身为产消合一者的我们，并没有因此而不快，相反，我们喜滋滋的享受其中。我认为产消合一的神奇正是在于它让我们喜滋滋的为银行节约了大量成本。同样的创意也体现在自助餐、超市上等等。
  随着互联网的发展，我发现，它正在成为产消合一者展示魅力的舞台。随着经济的迅猛发展，单调的产品越来越难以满足用户的需求，DIY成为了突出个性的一种方式，而我们通过互联网成为了一名产消合一者，制作出独一无二的产品（此类网站相当多，有中国秀客网、颜色网、印客网）我们可以DIY书籍、衣服、甚至打火机、马克杯。而现在吵得相当火热的web2.0也正是产消合一模式的展现，无论是博客、播客都在期待着用户贡献内容成为生产者，同时又是这类服务提供者的消费者。
  不过，产消合一并非理所应当的，“免费的”午餐也是需要理由的，正如我们享受自动提款机是因为它为我们节约了时间一样，我们在贡献内容时同样需要理由。Web2.0面临严寒的原因之一就是并没有提供足够的理由。相反DIY类网站就不同，追逐自己个性顾客成为产消合一者的理由。
  《财富的革命》正是这样一本趋势著作，通过三种深层原理让我们更好的了解现状，期待我们能够运用合适的产消合一模式改造现在的企业环节，节约更多的成本并增进创造力！
PS:对于掌握组织现在所发生的一些变化趋势有所帮助，对个人发展用处不是很大，不过还是非常不错的一本书。</text>

<summary_trans>The charm of production and elimination</summary_trans><text_trans>The Charm of Production and Elimination - A Comment on "The Revolution of Wealth"
What will happen in the future, many people have vowed to predict this, but perhaps even the current changes have not been understood, and now a change of wealth is under way, and this change is guided by the "three in the middle of" A deep principle: space, time and knowledge. "The Revolution of Wealth" is a book like this: through the interpretation of the deep principles, let us understand the world we live in more clearly in the whirlpool of change.
  The author Alvin Toffler is considered a famous futurist, and their work on trends is quite famous, and because the "wave of the third wave" in the book is familiar to us. The Revolution of Wealth is a book they published in 2006. The book tells us about the wealth revolution that is happening now and will continue to happen through rich and vivid examples.
  To reveal the power behind the wealth revolution, the authors grouped it into three deep principles: time, space, and knowledge. The phenomenon of out-synchronization is the manifestation of the principle of time. In social change, enterprises, education departments, and governments are adapting to change at different speeds, and because of the inconsistency in speed, the phenomenon of loss of synchronization is caused; the change of space is mainly reflected in wealth. The transfer, from a continent to the other continent; and finally, the principle of knowledge, obviously, is the knowledge revolution described by the third wave.
  A deep understanding of the changes that are taking place now, understanding its changes in time, space and knowledge, and therefore taking advantage of the situation. It is true that the deep principles are the core of this book, but I am more concerned about the production and elimination model mentioned in the Revolution of Wealth. What is the combination of production and elimination? To solve the problem literally, the producer and the consumer are combined into one.
  The bank's automatic teller machine is a typical embodiment of the production and elimination model. We “hands in” to “serve for ourselves”, and this service should have been provided by bank staff. At the moment we used the ATM, we became a producer and consumer. We are the consumer of banking services. And also a part of the producers. It is precisely because we change our identity from a simple consumer to a producer and consumer, and save a lot of human capital for the bank. When it is more valuable, we are not as fast as we are, and instead, We are happy to enjoy it. I think the magic of production and elimination is that it makes us happy and saves a lot of money for the bank. The same ideas are also reflected in buffets, supermarkets and more.
  With the development of the Internet, I found that it is becoming a stage for the showcase of charm. With the rapid development of the economy, monotonous products are more and more difficult to meet the needs of users, DIY has become a way to highlight individuality, and we have become a producer and consumer through the Internet, making a unique product (this There are quite a few websites, including China Show Network, Color Network, and Ink. We can DIY books, clothes, and even lighters and mugs. Nowadays, the web 2.0, which is quite hot, is also the showcase of the production and elimination model. Both blogs and podcasts are expecting users to contribute content to become producers, and at the same time consumers of such service providers.
  However, production and disintegration is not justified. The “free” lunch is also a reason. Just as we enjoy the ATM because it saves us time, we also need reasons when we contribute content. One of the reasons why Web2.0 is facing severe cold is that it does not provide sufficient reasons. On the contrary, DIY websites are different, and chasing their own individual customers is the reason for the production and consumption.
  "The Revolution of Wealth" is such a trend book. Through three deep principles, we can better understand the status quo, and expect us to use the appropriate production and elimination model to transform the current enterprise links, saving more costs and improving creativity!
PS: It is helpful to grasp some of the changes that the organization is taking now. It is not very useful for personal development, but it is still a very good book.</text_trans></item>

<text>无论是《火车》、《理由》、《继父》、《龙眠》，还是这部最有代表性的《模仿犯》，宫部美雪的书读起来总是那么毫无障碍，就像发生在身边的事情一样。
她的小说总是进行得很慢，这或许是她相比东野圭吾一类简洁明快的作家，比较难得到中国读者接受的最大原因。
但正因为开始时慢，酝酿的时间长，在展开剧情后便格外清晰细致，简直纤毫毕现，每个人的命运、与事件的牵扯及其影响都交待得清清楚楚。
她擅长刻画群像，无论主角配角、篇幅多少，都能令角色立体形象，过目难忘。
她笔下特别喜欢出现少年、普通人的家庭、可恨又可怜的反角，即所谓东京下町的生活。
她的文字不矫情，不痞气，不力求直白，不追求华丽，不卖弄炫学，不故弄玄虚，不标新立异。
但很讲究。
她让人感到一种无比柔和又坚定的力量。
她是真正的高手。早已超越了鲜衣怒马的阶段，随随便便不丁不八一站，已渊渟岳峙，气场席卷而至又沉静如水。</text>

<summary_trans>Miyabe Miyuki's book is worth reading</summary_trans><text_trans>Whether it is "train", "reason", "stepfather", "long sleep", or this most representative "imitation offense", Miyabe Miyuki's book is always so unobstructed, just like it happens. The same thing around you.
Her novels are always going very slowly, which may be the biggest reason why she is more difficult to get Chinese readers than the simple and bright writers of Higashino Keigo.
However, because it was slow at the beginning and it took a long time to brew, it was very clear and meticulous after the story was unfolded. It was almost complete, and the fate of each person, the involvement of the incident and its influence were clearly explained.
She is good at portraying group images, regardless of the protagonist's supporting role and length, it can make the character's three-dimensional image unforgettable.
Her pens especially like the appearance of teenagers, ordinary people's families, hateful and poor contradictions, the so-called life in Tokyo.
Her words are not esoteric, not arrogant, not seeking straightforwardness, not pursuing gorgeousness, not selling and learning, not confusing, not unconventional.
But very particular about it.
She feels a very soft and firm force.
She is a real master. It has already surpassed the stage of fresh clothes and anger horses, and it is not easy to stand up. It has already been a long way to go, and the gas field has swept and calmed down.</text_trans></item>

1. Translation is not good, difficult to understand words
2, obviously not introduced, just passing by, for beginners, it is difficult
3, typesetting, the focus is not prominent,
“No one wants to study the 5-day R course. In fact, this is not necessary. We recommend a three-day course called “Getting Started with R” (eight hours a day)”, speechless----
It can be done in Chapters 1-9 for 3 days.

-----以下是本人的读后感-----
本书存在着很多问题，例举如下：
（一）书中有较多勘误，比如
  页 章 节  错误内容
  ----------------------------------------------
 12 速查表 治耳炎、不应有"曲池"
 13  治咳嗽、应该有"孔最、列缺"等肺经穴位
  14  只有治"鼻尖"冻疮时、才用"迎香"
 15  治蛔虫、应该用"迎香"
231 6 3  "肺经"对应的不是小指而应是无名指
241 6 8  "板门"不在食指、而应在手掌大鱼际
（二）疾病部位速查表
1：3-6章中介绍的很多疾病没有列于速查表、使该表的实用性大打折扣。
2：速查表里的穴位和3-6章里的有出入(如咳嗽、13页和230页就不一样)
（三）第5章
  "标题部分的主治"和"详情部分的主治"，有很多出入。
（四）第6章
  1："穴位"和"主要选穴"有很多出入。
  2：此章中多次提到"补、泻"某经络，
  但却没有总体的"五指-脏器对应图"、"补泻的推拿方向图"。
  让家长看到文字后、不知该如何具体操作。
  详情请看我的博文《常用儿童五宣穴位按摩方法》

目前已经把以上问题反映给出版商了。
一旦有结果、再来修改评论。</text>

<summary_trans>Most of the "Popular Platinum Edition" reviewers are trusting!</summary_trans><text_trans>There are no "purchased logos", but they are all five-star reviews!
Look at their review resumes and five-star reviews for all the books!
Toto is not level, seriously despised!
Remind friends who buy books: Before buying, please refer to the user comments that have "purchased logo"!
-----The following is my reading-----
There are many problems in this book, as follows:
(1) There are many errata in the book, such as
  Page Chapter Error Content
  ----------------------------------------------
 12 quick lookup table to treat otitis, there should be no "curved pool"
 13 Treatment of cough, there should be "holes, columns, lack of" and other lung points
  14 Only use "Xiangxiang" when treating "nose tip" frostbite
 15 Treatment of mites, should use "welcome incense"
231 6 3 "Lung" corresponds to the little finger but the ring finger
241 6 8 "The door is not in the index finger, but in the palm of the big fish
(2) Quick list of disease sites
Many of the diseases described in Chapters 1:3-6 are not listed in the quick checklist, which makes the utility of the watch greatly compromised.
2: The points in the quick check table are different from those in chapters 3-6 (such as cough, 13 pages and 230 pages).
(3) Chapter 5
  There are many discrepancies in the "indications of the title section" and the "indications of the details section".
(4) Chapter 6
  1: There are many discrepancies between "acupoints" and "mainly selected points".
  2: In this chapter, I mentioned "addition and diarrhea" to a meridian.
  However, there is no overall "five fingers - organ correspondence map", "pushing massage map".
  After the parents see the text, I don’t know how to do it.
  For details, please see my blog post "Common Children's Wu Xuan Acupoint Massage Method"
  Blog.sina.com.cn/wenwu21cn
The above issues have been reflected to the publishers.
Once there is a result, modify the comment.</text_trans></item>

<text>不知道有没有看过安妮宝贝再看这本书的朋友，很多地方都能看出安妮的痕迹，但是也可能是作者自己的风格。个人感觉一般，故事指向性及其相似，部分描写还是挺好的，实在闲的没事可以看看打发时间，没什么实际意义，不建议购买。只是针对作品本身，不带有任何指向性，希望对大家能有用处。
  这本书是满99送畅销书的时候选的赠品，如果是自己买，不会买这样一本书。有兴趣的朋友可以看看安妮宝贝的《蔷薇岛屿》，不是一个等级的。治愈止痛之类的，看各人了，感受经历不同，共鸣点也会不一样。封面还是挺不错的一张图。我没有看完，看了2/3看不下去了。</text>

It is only for the work itself, without any directivity, I hope it will be useful to everyone.
  This book is a candidate for a 99 best-selling book. If you buy it yourself, you won't buy such a book. Interested friends can look at Anne Baby's "Rose Island", not a level. Healing pain and the like, watching each person, feeling different experiences, the resonance point will be different. The cover is still a very good picture. I didn't finish reading, I saw 2/3 and couldn't stand it anymore.</text_trans></item>

<summary>新版的旧书 ：（</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>还好是满[…]送的，不然悔死了！包装、纸质什么的反正我也没有太高的要求，这种书最多旅行前翻翻，带着走估计会散掉吧？开始看到书里有彩照还很高兴，可是翻了几个地方，真的非常失望！其实我选之前就看了别人的评论，只是有说好的不好的，所以还是想自己看看，唉~&gt;_&amp;lt;||
  虽然号称是2011年全新升级版，但翻翻就会发现，资料并没有更新。举个例子：厦门的厦大一条街，都拆迁了N年了，竟然还在推荐！虽然现在有了新的一条街，但已经不是书里说的什么不足千米的小街道了，那里早就成了能看见校园的铁栏杆了！
  拜托写书的人，随便用GOOGLE地图先到附近看一下都不至于犯这种错误吧？
  澳门的介绍也是，现在澳门路环凼仔中心一带的新濠天地、威尼斯人酒店早已成了旅游热地，吃喝玩乐赌一应俱全，而这本书推荐的范围还局限在小小的澳门岛，而且仍然把明显已经无法跟这些新酒店相提并论的酒店拿出来推荐。
  另外，作为一本旅游指南，怎么也应该把推荐的地方写得稍有点文采吧？
  没有！全然没有！！
  这本书似乎只关注讨价还价怎么省钱上，竟然建议游客混在旅游团里蹭听导游介绍的，还弄了个小灯泡的图标提醒，真是让人汗颜。
  翻了一些去过的地方的介绍，觉得有些文字语气怪异，不知是抱着什么心态在旅游的。
  比如说厦门的皓月园“站在皓月园内能看到的风景，在鼓浪屿里随处都能看到，所以，如果只是为了看雕像，倒不一定非去不可。”说鳌园“如果是出于对陈嘉庚先生的尊敬，这里是厦门之旅不能漏掉的。不过，除了门廊两侧的青石浮雕，可看的东西并不是很多。”
  购物也是，“买海鲜干货主要在于讲价，开口就喊5折的价，不能心太软……”
  那麻烦您移步到商场买吧？家乐福、沃尔玛、大润发到处都能买到，不要乱写破坏厦门的形象！
  说到吃的也是，“以蒜泥、沙茶酱等做佐料，口味更香脆，不过吃之前最好确认海蛎是否新鲜。”真是太过份了！说的是海蛎煎吗？明明是用蒜蓉辣酱，从没见人用蒜泥、沙茶酱，您是在吃烤生蚝吗？真让人无语~
  我不知道其他城市地区的人看了是什么感觉，反正书里很少有真正介绍风土人情文化历史的，象西安一开头就写“作为一个旅行者，西安给人更多的是一种失落的感觉。遍布古都的历史遗迹中最常见的就是小贩，他们把所有的东西拿来卖，包括信誉和真诚。”这句话在旧版上也有，看完印象很深，挺不是滋味的。
  这本书能畅销10年真是奇迹。</text>

<text>买了此书后，试做了书中几乎90%的糕点。在此之前，我没有接触过任何烘焙常识，但按照书中的讲解，几乎0失败。
  此书很适合新手上路，每款糕点每个步骤都有详细的插图，书里告诉你某个重要的步骤，需要注意什么，也告诉你了各种烘焙中可能出现的问题。
  书里的食材都很平民化，在麦德龙超市可以买全。
  总之 是一个不错的新手入门的烘焙书。
 另外：我还在卓越上买了廖敏云的《手创饼干112道》，买此书的原因是因为她号称“有木糖醇和一般白砂糖的对换比例”，结果有上当的感觉，因为木糖醇和白砂糖一般是可以等比例对换的，仅此一句话。此书不如《君之》详细，应该属于进阶阶段的书籍吧。</text>

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>网上购书以来，除了工具书，最失望的一本书。第一，书是坏的，书脊上部烂掉了。第二，书少了35页，不知道怎么印刷的，从第14页，直接跳到了207页，所幸在40多页之后又跳回了第49页。中间内容连不上。第三，也是最重要的，这本书不好看，作者废话连篇，说是四姐妹吧，各种背景介绍的太多，都过了三分之一了，还没开始写四姐妹。最烦人的是介绍一个人物比如老大元和吧，写她老公，就拿出好几页的篇幅介绍了他老公以前演的角色，昆曲的背景什么的，太打断读者了。书的前几章还行，没那么啰嗦，越往后越啰嗦啊。也许和翻译有关系，作者毕竟是美国人，按照美国人的习惯写的，也是面对国外读者的。作为一个中国人看着实在费劲啊，毫无乐趣，跟说明文一样，也不符合我们写传记或者人物的习惯。总之，坚决不推荐，要想了解四姐妹，建议看《周有光百岁口述》《最后的闺秀》，甚至落尘写的《民国的气质》张充和篇，也比这本书强的没影~</text>

<summary_trans>The book is bad</summary_trans><text_trans>Since the purchase of books online, in addition to the reference books, the most disappointing book. First, the book is bad, and the upper part of the spine is rotten. Second, the book is 35 pages less. I don't know how to print it. From page 14, I jumped directly to 207 pages. Fortunately, after more than 40 pages, I jumped back to page 49. The middle content can't connect. Third, and most importantly, this book is not good-looking. The author is nonsense, and it is said that it is four sisters. There are too many background introductions, and one third has passed, and four sisters have not yet begun to write. The most annoying thing is to introduce a character such as Lao Da Yuan and bar, write her husband, and take out a few pages to introduce the role of his husband's previous performance, the background of Kunqu Opera, too interrupted the reader. The first few chapters of the book are okay, not so embarrassing, the more you go back. Perhaps related to translation, the author is an American after all, according to American habits, but also facing foreign readers. Being a Chinese person is really hard, no fun, just like the explanatory text, it is not in line with our habit of writing biographies or characters. In short, resolutely not recommended, if you want to understand the four sisters, it is recommended to watch "Zhou Youguang's 100-year-old oral narration", "The Last 闺秀", and even the "The Temperament of the Republic of China" written by Zhang Chonghe, which is stronger than this book~</text_trans></item>

<text>众所周知，山海经是洪荒时代的产物，生僻字在所难免（实际上是多得很！）本书虽然有注音，但也有很多生僻字是没有注音的，这点让作为读者的我很是尴尬=口=|||（这些字我上哪查去！？）
图文并茂，主要有元明清三个时代佼佼者的画作，还特地上了色，实在是好看，在想象时帮了不少忙。还特地标明在神话中出现分歧的地方。然则不是所有提及的怪兽、植物都有配图的。
本书包括原文、翻译、注释，对文言文学习很有帮助，对懂得文言文的人能直接看到原文当然是最好的。还有表格，清晰地分类了该山该海有哪些动物、植物、矿物，但却不是每一篇都有的，这确实让我头疼，在分布认识上表格可是帮了很大忙的。

<summary_trans>Graphic and textual, with phonetic, original, translation, notes</summary_trans><text_trans>As everyone knows, Shan Hai Jing is a product of the ruined era. Uncommon words are inevitable (in fact, it is very much!) Although there are phonetic notes in this book, there are also many uncommon words that are not phonetic. This makes me a reader. = mouth =|||(Where are these words I checked??)
The pictures and texts are mainly composed of the paintings of the three eras of the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties. They are also specially painted, which is really good-looking and has helped a lot in imagination. It also specifically indicates where there is disagreement in mythology. However, not all the mentioned monsters and plants have pictures.
This book includes the original text, translation, and annotations. It is very helpful for the study of classical Chinese. It is of course the best for those who understand the classical Chinese to see the original text directly. There are also tables that clearly classify the animals, plants, and minerals in the sea, but not every one of them. This really makes me a headache. The distribution of the table is very helpful.
This book is worth recommending.</text_trans></item>

<summary>中国的社会阶段、教育现状需要这类书…</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>斗胆在这里发表自己看法，非常的斗胆，因为跟周围的很多人比起来 自我感觉是一个阅读能力很差的学生。别人都能很快的看完一本书，而我看的总是很慢，每次都是一个字一个字的看。
因为自己读书很慢，阅读的能力很差，所以本人总是在不断的探寻改变自己的这方面缺陷。之间，走了很多很多的歪路。这里面的原因可以说是多方面的。有学校教育水平、社会发展、经济条件、家庭环境、等等。。这些多数都是外在的原因。因为外在因素的影响导致自己内心虽然急切的想掌握阅读能力，而苦于寻找不到。（呵呵，最近能让我接触的这本书，间接也可以说明我们的国家强大了啊！）
今年我们的国家建国就要62年了。62年前我们的人民绝大多数还都是不识字的，连我们的政党组成人里都有很多不识字的人。但是经过祖国的不断努力，到现在，我们的国家已经基本上没有不识字的人了。我是80后的人，记得在小时候有段年月里，社会里很流行一个词——‘文盲’，那是文盲这两个字可以算是骂人的话。。概括的说，我们人民是在我们这一代里消灭了文盲。（自我感觉很荣幸！)
文盲是消除，但接下来呢？今年我们也要毕业了，现在的大学生越来越多，可是社会对我们评价不好，多数说成是‘书呆子’，我作为一个学生，我们承认这是我们弊病。我们想改变，但是心有余而力不足。党的十六大、十七大报告连续指出，要“建设全民学习、终身学习的学习型社会”。这种学习型社会如何实现？？？
在书的第三章最后一段，是这么说的“就算我们完成了眼前的任务，仍然还没有完成整个工作。我们一定要比一个人人识字的国家更进一步。我们国人应该变成一个真正‘有能力’的阅读者，能够真正认知‘有能力’这个字眼的涵义。达不到这样的境界，我们就无法应对未来的世界”。这是一本美国人在72年写的书，想想在中国的40年前人家别的国家就已经有了这样的想法，是多么有超前意识！今天当我看到那句话的时候，我感到很有压力。人家在40年前就提出来的观点，我们还不知道 或者说刚刚明白其意义。。
写到这里了，可以看出，我的写作能力也是很差，不光是阅读这一项。这些能力是我进步的最基本能力，一定要想法设法掌握熟练 并精通 成为一生的习惯。因为这样的能力是我打开智慧宝藏的基础，掌握的越好，越能事半功倍！！
仅作为学习所得，跟大家略来分享。自己很有很多不足，望大家指正..谢谢。。</text>

<summary_trans>China’s social stage and education status require such books...</summary_trans><text_trans>I am very daring to express my opinion here, because I feel like a student with poor reading ability compared with many people around me. Others can read a book very quickly, and I always look very slow, each time a word and a word.
Because I am slow to read, and my reading ability is very poor, I am constantly searching for defects in this aspect of changing myself. Between, I walked a lot of roads. The reason for this can be said to be multifaceted. There are school education levels, social development, economic conditions, family environment, and so on. . Most of these are external reasons. Because of the influence of external factors, my heart is eager to master reading ability, but I can't find it. (Oh, the book that I recently contacted can indirectly explain that our country is strong!)
This year our country will be built 62 years. Most of our people 62 years ago were still illiterate. Even our party members had many illiterate people. However, through the continuous efforts of the motherland, up to now, our country has basically no illiterate people. I am a post-80s person. I remember that when I was a child, there was a popular word in the society--"literal blindness". That is the word illiterate can be regarded as a swearing word. . In a nutshell, our people have wiped out illiteracy in our generation. (I feel very honored!)
Illiteracy is eliminated, but what about next? We have to graduate this year. Now there are more and more college students, but the society does not evaluate us badly. Most of them are ‘nerds’. As a student, we admit that this is our ill. We want to change, but we have more than enough strength. The 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China continuously pointed out that it is necessary to "build a learning society for all people to learn and learn for life." How is this learning society realized? ? ?
In the last paragraph of the third chapter of the book, it is said, “Even if we complete the task at hand, we still have not completed the whole work. We must go further than a country where everyone is literate. Our people should become a real’ Readers with the ability to truly recognize the meaning of the word 'capable'. Without such a realm, we cannot cope with the future world." This is a book written by Americans in 72 years. I think that in China, 40 years ago, people in other countries already had such an idea. How advanced is it! Today, when I saw that sentence, I felt very stressed. The views that people put forward 40 years ago, we still don't know or just understand the meaning. .
Written here, you can see that my writing ability is also very poor, not only reading this one. These abilities are the most basic abilities of my progress. I must try to master the proficiency and be proficient in my life. Because this ability is the basis for me to open the treasure of wisdom, the better I master, the more I can do more with less! !
Just for learning, share it with everyone. I have a lot of deficiencies, I hope you correct me. Thank you. .</text_trans></item>

It seems that it is for the purpose of copying a number of Inamori Kazuo through the Amoeba business. If the photo is really for this purpose, the design of the publishing house is really very hard. The book describes why there is an amoeba management and specific implementation methods. I feel that reading a book by Dao Shengfu is equivalent to reading all his books, because all his books are preaching his business philosophy. If you are interested in the content of the amoeba business, this book can still be read.</text_trans></item>

但是乱序本的单词要多！4320个,这一本才3900个。而且，乱序本收录的词解释也比这本要详细多了！
如果两本书同时有的单词，乱序本要多3-5个意思不等。。
另外，这本书的mp3就是只读一下单词，再读一下第一个意思。。。

<summary>亚马逊网购书评——关于《寻路中国》与《江城》</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>“所有那些对台版图书、港版图书抱着盲目崇拜的人士，该醒醒了！”——这是我在对比阅读完大陆、台湾出版的两个版本的何伟的《寻路中国》与《江城》之后，发出的由衷的提醒！
  其实对于我，购书的过程就很纠结，看看那些评论吧：“应该不是全本……阉割了不少内容……”，所以我也就在大陆、港书、台书的几个售书网站上纠结着，到底买哪个版本读才好？后来在一个香港图书的论坛上，看到一个香港的读者留言“问什么非要买港台的图书呢？那么贵，我们现在都到大陆去买书。”于是我不再犹豫，立即就在亚马逊网站订购了这两本书。
  阅读的过程非常愉快：我不时地捧腹大笑或是会心微笑，或是心潮澎湃、或是豁然开朗。对于书中的内容，无需我再多加赘述和评论，而对于这个愉悦的阅读之旅，我衷心地感激、赞赏李雪顺译者付出的辛勤劳动！同时我欣喜的是，我们的出版业也已经超乎长期以来形成的偏见——书本的内容足够开放、完整，至少在我看来，作者系统性的故事、思维、分析保持得很好，没有因为“被删节”而破碎的痕迹。因而欣喜阅读的同时，我始终无法忘却那些酸涩的评论，我的内心始终充满怀疑——我要看看台湾的译本到底好在哪里！
  经济能力于我不是什么大的问题，至少对于买几本港台原版图书而言。连邮费300块买来台湾八旗出版社出版的何伟的中国三部曲，先看封面、再看内容，感受就俩字——失望！
  100块钱一本的书啊，从封面到装帧到排版到印刷质量，我看不出和大陆亚马逊网站上只需其1/4价格（25元）的同类书的质的差别——可偏偏还有人热捧！醒醒吧！我们的书印刷质量一点儿也不差！我们的封面设计更引人入胜：无论是切题的“稻草人交警”还是搏击于长江激流的运草船工的封面照片——试问：哪个更引人入胜？！哪个已将文章的主旨昭然若揭？！！！
  再看译文水平——这个应该从翻译文学“信达雅”的角度来探讨吧？简单举例：
  《江城》第一段末句：
  台湾版：小城在车窗外匆匆掠过，在星光下显得幽暗而陌生。
  大陆版：星光下，这座城市不断向后掠去，显得陌生而又迷离。
  哪一句更富有朗朗上口的韵律美？
  《江城》第二段末句：
  台湾版：除此之外，我们得到的资讯十分有限。
  大陆版：除此，我知之甚微。
  哪一句更富于“简约之雅”？
  疑点句：
  台湾版：他们长途跋涉了一千五百公里，最后在延安落得身无分文。在我看来，这倒是向中国共产党历史致敬的一种十分贴切的方式。
  大陆版：为了纪念中国共产党的历史，远行一千英里，来到延安，却以破产告终，这种特别的方式让我惊讶万分。
  不知是谁按照自己的理解意译了原文？两岸三地，文化差异？
  台湾版：但是，李校长帮助他们脱离困境。
  大陆版：不过李校长早就把他们解救出来了。
  谁的读起来更顺口？更幽默？
  再说一句，读台湾的译本，我笑不出来！美式幽默，消失殆尽！
  ……
  够了，够了，如此的例句不胜枚举。而对于《寻路中国》，我已不屑再这样对比，因为那纯属浪费时间和精力，我已经浪费了300块钱，不想再为其支出更多。《寻路中国》的简体本出版就是个胜利——上海译文出版社以其犀利的目光、敏锐的嗅觉先声夺人，从出版时间、从书本内容、从译文质量——开放的中国领先了！
  富有讽刺意味的是，在给我寄来的台湾版本的书籍中还夹有一份“天下文化”的新书广告，首先映入眼帘的就是《教育应该不一样（台湾不愿面对的教育真相）》。在这里，我无意对比讨论两岸的教育现状，在这方面，我绝不想贬低谁或是抬高谁；但是在我看来，关于何伟这两本著作的大陆更胜一筹的译本，既让我感到欣喜又引发了我的忧虑：欣喜的是我们的作家、译者的水平不输人后；忧虑的是，越是在全国大范围、长时间宣传的读书活动，越是表明新生代、甚至是全民的阅读匮乏，加之全球化浪潮的迅猛扫荡，我们的文化走向何方？凝重大雅之美的传统文化情归何处？再过20年，我们还会有这样的译文和更杰出的创作吗？
  开放的中国，改革地大踏步前进，稳定与发展的民生诉求……但愿明天会更好。

<summary_trans>Amazon Online Book Review - About "Pathfinder China" and "Jiangcheng"</summary_trans><text_trans>"All those who hold blind worship on Taiwanese books and Hong Kong books should wake up!" - This is my comparison of the two versions of He Wei's "Pathfinder China" published in mainland China and Taiwan. After the "Jiangcheng", the heartfelt reminder issued!
  In fact, for me, the process of buying books is very entangled, look at those comments: "It should not be the whole book... castrated a lot of content...", so I also sell books in mainland China, Hong Kong books, and Taiwanese books. The website is entangled, which version to read in the end? Later, in a forum for Hong Kong books, I saw a reader's message from Hong Kong, "Why do you want to buy a book from Hong Kong and Taiwan? So expensive, we are now going to the mainland to buy books." So I no longer hesitate, immediately on the Amazon website. Ordered these two books.
  The process of reading is very enjoyable: I laugh from time to time or smile, or have a heart-warming or open-mindedness. For the content of the book, I don't need to add more comments and comments. For this pleasant reading trip, I sincerely appreciate and appreciate the hard work of Li Xueshun's translator! At the same time, I am gratified that our publishing industry has surpassed the long-standing prejudice - the content of the book is open and complete enough. At least in my opinion, the author's systematic story, thinking, and analysis are well maintained. Traces of broken because of "cut abridged." Therefore, while I am happy to read, I can't forget the sour comments. My heart is always full of doubts - I want to see where the Taiwanese translation is!
  Economic ability is not a big problem for me, at least for buying a few Hong Kong and Taiwan original books. Even the postage of 300 pieces of He Wei's Chinese trilogy published by Taiwan's Eight Banners Publishing House, first look at the cover, then look at the content, feel the two words - disappointment!
  A book of 100 bucks, from cover to binding to typography to print quality, I can't see the difference in quality from the same book on the mainland Amazon website that only needs 1/4 price (25 yuan) - can be biased There are still people who are eager! wake up! The quality of our book printing is not bad at all! Our cover design is even more fascinating: whether it's the "Scarer Traffic Police" or the cover photo of the boatman who fights on the Yangtze River torrent - ask: Which is more fascinating? ! Which one has made the main point of the article clear? ! ! !
  Look at the level of translation again - should this be discussed from the perspective of the translation of the letter "Cinda Ya"? Simple example:
  The last sentence of the first paragraph of "Jiangcheng":
  Taiwan version: The small town rushed past the window of the car, appearing dark and strange under the stars.
  Continental version: Under the stars, the city is constantly looting backwards, seemingly strange and confusing.
  Which sentence is more prosperous and rhythmic?
  The last sentence of the second paragraph of "Jiangcheng":
  Taiwan version: In addition, the information we get is very limited.
  Mainland version: Apart from this, I know very little.
  Which sentence is more rich in "simple elegance"?
  Doubtful sentence:
  Taiwan version: They traveled a long distance of 1,500 kilometers and finally ended up in Yan'an without a penny. In my opinion, this is a very appropriate way to pay tribute to the history of the Chinese Communist Party.
  The mainland version: In order to commemorate the history of the Chinese Communist Party, a thousand miles went to Yan'an, but ended in bankruptcy. This special way surprised me.
  I do not know who translated the original text according to their own understanding? Cultural differences between the three sides of the strait?
  Taiwan version: However, President Li helped them out of the woods.
  Mainland version: But President Li has already rescued them.
  Who is more readable? More humorous?
  Let me say that I can't laugh when I read Taiwan's translation! American humor, disappeared!
  ......
  Enough, enough, such examples are too numerous to enumerate. As for "Pathfinder China", I have disdained this comparison, because it is a waste of time and energy. I have wasted 300 yuan and I don't want to spend more. The simplified publication of "Pathfinder China" is a victory - Shanghai Translation Publishing House takes its sharp eyes and sharp sense of smell first, from publishing time, from book content, to translation quality - open China leads!
  Ironically, the Taiwanese version of the book sent to me also contains a new book advertisement for "Tianxia Culture". The first thing that comes to mind is that "education should be different (the educational truth that Taiwan does not want to face). 》. Here, I have no intention to compare and discuss the status quo of education between the two sides of the strait. In this respect, I would never want to belittle anyone or raise it; but in my opinion, the translation of He Wei’s two books is even better. I am delighted and raised my worries: I am delighted that the level of our writers and translators is not lost. The worry is that the more widely-recognized reading activities in the country, the more the new generation, Even the lack of reading for all the people, coupled with the rapid sweeping of the wave of globalization, where does our culture go? Where is the traditional culture of the beauty of beauty? In the next 20 years, will we still have such translations and more outstanding creations?
  Open China, reforms are making great strides, and the people's livelihood demands for stability and development... I hope tomorrow will be even better.

On the other hand, he instilled a lot of knowledge in his subjects every day, regardless of whether the child can absorb and accept it. On the one hand, let the children solve their own problems and make their sons and their status. Equality, on the other hand, interferes with the freedom of the son to make friends, deprives him of the right to play with his peers, and says that “no friends will not lose childlike interest”; on the other hand, he repeatedly stressed that he did not want to be famous by his son. Just hope that he will become a fully developed person, on the other hand, he often invites others to "examine" the child, and also leads him to lectures everywhere...</text_trans></item>

You must understand that we cannot make predictions; don't worry about your choice. Whether it is correct, but to make your choices correct." "Effective decision-making methods can generate possible options and results, and make us realize that each option has its own advantages, and any one can satisfy the needs, and then believe Anxiety for cost and benefit is not necessary.” Now I have some feelings, that is, make a choice first, then believe it and turn it into an optimal option.</text_trans></item>

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>此书作者名声虽响，实为沽名钓誉之徒。全书实际是从寥寥数本英文书抄袭拼凑而成，并且有许多错误。有许多地方，抄者自己都没读懂。可笑作者还整天到处吹嘘自己是个人文学者，实际上连学者起码必备的治学态度与学术道德都没有。
蔑视理论是不对的，但轻信权威也是同样的错误。建议各位别再把自己的钱浪费在这么一本垃圾书上了。</text>

<summary_trans>Garbage book</summary_trans><text_trans>Although the author's reputation is loud, it is a famous reputation. The book is actually made up of a copy of the English book plagiarism, and there are many errors. There are many places where the copyers themselves did not understand. The ridiculous author also boasted that he was a personal literary person all day long. In fact, even scholars at least have the necessary academic attitude and academic ethics.
It is wrong to despise theory, but it is the same mistake to believe in authority. I suggest that you don't waste your money on such a garbage book.</text_trans></item>

<text>1、从整体上说，收到这本书后我不太满意，我给打两星的原因不是因为书的本身不好，而是书的包装和配送方面极其有问题！但是这次有优惠活动，赶上活动购买比较实惠；
2、从书本质量方面看，质量不错，是正品，值得相信；
3、从配货速度看，速度有点慢，不尽如人意，最重要的是中通公司配货时竟然让我们顾客自己去快递公司取货！以前从来都是快递公司给送到顾客指定的交货地点，结果这次竟然出现了这样的事情，我无法接受！
4、从外包装方面，我很不满意，包装有破损，而且破损严重，内部的书污损太厉害了！我同时买了四本书，这本书是最脏的，书的封面有破损，外面的书脊处也是污迹斑斑！我买的是新书，一眼没看就那么脏，实在太影响心情！
5、我以前也在亚马逊买过书，都没有出现类似的情况，一直觉得亚马逊很朴实，前几次的购物经历也不错，但是不知道这次书的破损是什么原因，致使我这次的购物经历真的很不愉快，希望下次亚马逊能够改进。</text>

<summary_trans>Honest evaluation: History of Foreign Teachers</summary_trans><text_trans>1. As a whole, I am not satisfied with this book. The reason why I gave two stars is not because the book itself is not good, but the packaging and distribution of the book is extremely problematic! But this time there are special promotions, it is more affordable to catch up with the event;
2, from the quality of books, the quality is good, is genuine, it is worth believing;
3, from the distribution speed, the speed is a bit slow, not satisfactory, the most important thing is that when the company is in the distribution, let our customers go to the courier company to pick up the goods! I used to be the delivery place designated by the courier company to the customer. As a result, this happened, I can't accept it!
4. From the aspect of outer packaging, I am very dissatisfied, the packaging is damaged, and the damage is serious, and the internal book is too dirty! I bought four books at the same time. This book is the dirtiest. The cover of the book is damaged, and the outer spine is also stained! I bought a new book, it was so dirty without looking at it, it really affected the mood!
5, I used to buy books in Amazon, there is no similar situation, I always feel that Amazon is very simple, the previous shopping experience is also good, but I don't know what the damage of this book is, which caused me this time. The shopping experience is really unpleasant, I hope that Amazon can improve next time.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Start now, pay attention to financial management</summary_trans><text_trans>At the same time, I bought two financial books from the Amazon, "Father Dad Poor Dad" and "The Babylonian Money Management Class". Both books are classic. The biggest inspiration for the previous one is to not use the only capital to buy. Need, but use this capital to roll out the assets to complete the dream. For me at the present stage, "The Babylonian Money Management Class" is more suitable for me. For me who wants to manage money very much and don't know how to manage money, "The Babylonian Money Management Class" really makes me stunned. I have benefited a lot. It turned out that I didn't like reading books, but I didn't find such a good-looking book. I just didn't think it was like this book, but when I started reading, I found a huge treasure and I couldn't wait to read it.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Kung Hang Hang Niang Pit Student</summary_trans><text_trans>This book claims to have the true title of 1986-2004, in fact, only 1997-2004 eight years. The analysis of 1986-1996 was downloaded online, and the price/performance ratio was too bad. .
It is better to do new questions first. These questions are too old. I don’t know if 2014 is such a proposition.
In addition, why is there a kind of pinch that can't be seen? ! Can I understand this "exhaustive" as actually "squeaky"? It is estimated that this book will be scrapped. .</text_trans></item>

<summary>看不到出版社的诚意，书的包装质量很差</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>换了2次，换到不想换了，最后的拿到的在盒子边角处还是有凹痕。
看不到出版社的诚意，此书名为《传家》，但书本身应该不会传很久。很薄并且容易坏的外壳，胶水分装（至少应该线装吧）。书的封面封底都有脏脏的感觉。送人的话还是推荐买台版的吧。
我想作者的意图不是希望读者一口气把书看完然后永远放在书架上，而是在适当的时候，经常和家人一起分享不同季节的心得，甚至不同年龄对书内容的不同感悟。而此书的质量却让人不敢恭维。
希望出版社认真的对待此书，如果你觉你的售价不能让你做到“诚意”二字的话，请提到一个适当的价格，然后认真做好一本书。如果这样质量已经是你的极致的话，那请让给别的出版社，谢谢！</text>

<summary_trans>I can't see the sincerity of the publishing house, the packaging quality of the book is very poor.</summary_trans><text_trans>Changed 2 times, changed to not want to change, and finally got a dent in the corner of the box.
I can't see the sincerity of the publishing house. This book is called "Hengjia", but the book itself should not be passed for a long time. Very thin and easy to break the shell, glue moisture (at least should be installed). The cover of the book has a dirty feel on the back cover. If you give someone, it is recommended to buy a version.
I think the author's intention is not to hope that the reader will read the book in one go and then put it on the shelf forever, but at the appropriate time, often share the experience of different seasons with the family, and even different perceptions of the book content at different ages. The quality of this book is not flattering.
I hope that the publisher will treat this book seriously. If you feel that your price cannot make you "sincerity", please mention an appropriate price and then do a good job. If this quality is already your ultimate, please let another publisher, thank you!</text_trans></item>

It is estimated that the photocopy is covered with a small piece of paper when the photocopying is printed. The book is printed, and the publisher checks it and uses it. A business card paper, printed on the three grid letters, and apologizes and explains, please cut and paste it yourself. This is also a lovely way to minimize losses and be more responsible. And with the commemoration, the paper is different, and there are not a few people who actually cut it and put it on the page.

本书对应《新版中日交流标准日本语》的教材内容，每课均设有五个部分，分别如下。
一、学习重点提示：突出醒目显示语法、句型等知识要点。提示读者在学习过程中针对要点多下工夫。
二、重点词语详解：权威中文释义与实用例句。使读者全面掌握单词的用法，而不仅仅停留在简单、枯燥地记忆单词。
三、重点语法解说：课文中出现的基本用法解说，相近用法辨析。使读者从根太上掌握日语的特点，基础扎实，语法清晰。
四、常用词汇归纳：分门别类总结常用词汇，提高单词记忆效率（初级上辅导），举一反三。
  太可恶了，本人是看了该书冠冕堂皇的简介才决定买的，结果大失所望，这是欺诈行为！希望贵公司能给本人一个说法！！！！</text>

<summary_trans>The content description does not match the real thing.</summary_trans><text_trans>brief introduction
This book corresponds to the textbook content of the "New Edition of Sino-Japanese Communication Standard Japanese". Each lesson has five parts, which are as follows.
First, the key points of learning: highlight the prominent points of grammar, sentence patterns and other knowledge. The reader is prompted to work harder on the points in the learning process.
Second, the detailed words and phrases: authoritative Chinese interpretation and practical example sentences. Allow readers to fully grasp the usage of words, rather than just remembering words in a simple, boring way.
Third, the key grammar explanation: the basic usage explanations appearing in the text, the similar usage analysis. Let the reader grasp the characteristics of Japanese from the roots, the foundation is solid, and the grammar is clear.
Fourth, the common vocabulary induction: sorting common vocabulary by category, improve word memory efficiency (primary counseling), give one another.
  It’s awful, I just read the book’s high-profile profile before I decided to buy it. The result was disappointing. This is fraud! I hope your company can give me a statement! ! ! !</text_trans></item>

<summary>或许该叫心理学导论更合适，适合做课本，不适合做阅读物</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>本以为可以从中学到心理学在生活中的应用，挖掘生活细节中的心理学道理，但是读下来感觉跟生活没大关系，基本上就是一个心理学的overview，每种理论都试图包含进来，但每种都只是简单点一下，如果想要了解细节，还需要专门找相关的书来看。前面很多章都是谈心理学跟生理学的关系，对一般读者来说用处不大。举例来说，最近看的是动机那章，看下来，各种流行的研究方法是知道有，但是如果有人问我，弗洛伊德心理哲学对生活的帮助，我肯定回答不上来，我脑子里留下来的只有一句，佛洛伊德认为一切行为都来源于动机。因为原书写得太浅。
另外谈谈翻译，我跟另外一本书社会心理学一起买的。那本就翻译的很好，很流畅。这本，看起来翻译的人更多，也有社会心理学的译者参与翻译，但是我看的几章，非常非常涩，从译文推测，可能跟原文有很多嵌套的长句从句有关。但我认为，既然标榜译者是北大心理学系教授云云，遇到这种长句，就不该试图直译，可以加上自己的理解，借助自己的心理学功底，用自己的话表达，只要把原文的精髓意思传递出来了就行了。总之这么涩的译文看着挺难受的。
如果大家想拿它当读物，或者跟我之前一样想把生活中经常遇到的事情上升到心理学高度来学习，那么别买这本书。</text>

<summary_trans>Perhaps it is more appropriate to call the introduction to psychology, suitable for textbooks, not suitable for reading.</summary_trans><text_trans>I thought I could learn the application of psychology in life and explore the psychological principles in the details of life, but I didn’t have much to do with life. It was basically a psychological overview, and every theory tried to be included. But each one is just a simple point. If you want to know the details, you need to look for the relevant books. Many of the previous chapters talk about the relationship between psychology and physiology, which is of little use to the average reader. For example, the most recent look at the chapter on motivation, look at it, the various popular research methods are known, but if someone asks me, Freud's psychological philosophy helps life, I can't answer it, my brain There is only one sentence left, and Freud believes that all actions are derived from motivation. Because the original writing is too shallow.
Also talk about translation, I bought it with another book, Social Psychology. That translation is very good and very smooth. This book, it seems that there are more translators, and translators of social psychology are involved in translation, but the chapters I read are very very embarrassing. From the translation, it may be related to the original long sentence clauses. But I think that since the advertised translator is Yun Yun, a professor of psychology at Peking University, if you encounter such a long sentence, you should not try to translate it directly. You can add your own understanding, use your own psychological foundation, and express it in your own words. The essence of the original text is passed on. In short, such awkward translation looks very uncomfortable.
Don't buy this book if you want to take it as a reading, or if you want to raise the things you often encounter in your life to the height of psychology.</text_trans></item>

<summary>啰嗦，添了很多不必要的个人评论</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>今天拿到的书，刚翻了一点点，实在忍不住了，上来评论一下。本来是很简单易懂富含哲理的寓言故事类的，偏偏加了很多题外的描述，让人觉得太繁琐了，没有突出重点。书中有很多花里胡巧的花边，看得我头晕。插画也是，黑白的很繁琐的插画，给人感觉不简洁，如果是彩色的可能还会好一些。总之比起其他版本的，这个真的要差一些。
  强烈推荐《巴比伦富翁：成功就是比他人优秀一点点》，这是我在大学图书馆看的第一本巴比伦富翁的故事，精装版的书，薄薄的，就很简洁的说了这些故事，没有多余的话，读了自然就懂了，收益匪浅。可惜这个2004年出版的，现在已经买不到了。然后就是《巴比伦最富有的人》这是我后来在新华文轩原价买的，就是跟“富爸爸”一起出版的，紫色封面的书，比前面这一本厚一些，字体大一些，也还算是比较简洁，反复看了好多遍，还勾画了重点的，后来表姐过来看着喜欢，就让她带回去给我的小侄子们看去了。</text>

<summary_trans>Hey, added a lot of unnecessary personal comments.</summary_trans><text_trans>The book I got today, just turned a little bit, I really couldn’t help it, let’s comment. Originally, it was very simple to understand the philosophical fable story. It added a lot of extra-title descriptions, which made people feel too cumbersome and did not highlight the key points. There are a lot of flowers in the book, I can see that I am dizzy. The illustration is also a very cumbersome illustration of black and white, which gives people a feeling that it is not concise. If it is color, it may be better. In short, this is really worse than other versions.
  I highly recommend "Babylon's rich man: success is a little better than others", this is the story of the first Babylonian I saw in the university library, the hardcover edition of the book, thin, very simple to say these stories, If you don't have extra words, you will understand it naturally when you read it. Unfortunately, this publication in 2004 is now impossible to buy. Then there is "The richest man in Babylon". This is what I bought at the original price of Xinhua Wenxuan. It was published together with "Fu Da Da". The purple cover book is thicker than the previous one, and the font is bigger. It is relatively simple, repeated reading many times, but also outlined the key points. Later, when the cousin came over and looked at it, she asked her to bring it back to my little nephews.</text_trans></item>

这是为什么呀？？？，，难道我在签收的时候就要挨着每本检查一下有没有缺页才收？这也忒搞笑了。。。
气愤气愤气愤，非常之气愤！！！</text>

<summary_trans>Seriously missing pages! ! ! Very angry! ! !</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought four books on April 24th.
Amazon is expected to arrive on May 2nd.
"Muslim's Funeral" is the last one to see. I know that today I jumped from 486 pages to 519 pages, and the whole one was missing 32 pages! ! !
Contact customer service, she said that the 30-day deadline has passed, can not be exchanged!
Why? ? ? ,, do I have to check every time I check if there is a missing page? This is also funny. . .

<summary>太专业的一本书</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>春节放假几天，今天看完了这本书，原本是寄予厚望的，因为看过了《解读中国经济》，对林教授的书是很敬重的。但这本书太专业了，很多名词知识都不懂，而且林教授是写的英文原版，这本中文版是别人翻译的，难免跟原版风格会有差异。如果是林教授自己来写中文版，会不会更好读呢？囫囵吞枣读完了，只留下一点点印象，建议大家还是先补补国际经济的课再买来读吧。</text>

<summary_trans>Too professional a book</summary_trans><text_trans>A few days off during the Spring Festival holiday, I read this book today. It was originally a high hope, because I have read "Interpreting China's Economy" and I am very respectful of Professor Lin's book. But this book is too professional, many noun knowledge does not understand, and Professor Lin is the original English version, this Chinese version is translated by others, inevitably different from the original style. If Professor Lin himself wrote the Chinese version, would it be better to read it? After reading the recipe, I only left a little impression. I suggest that you still buy the lessons of the international economy before you buy it.</text_trans></item>

<summary>实际购买后推荐给孩子的书</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>首先推荐些给孩子的好书。我选书的标准是能提高孩子的创造性的书，让孩子更自由，更快乐，更坚强和美好的成长，而不是提高学习成绩，我的孩子现在7个月，我已经给她买了几箱子书留着了。您要相信我推荐的都是经典。但是也许不是一些追求实效的书。我认为孩子培养成健全的人是最重要的。我们的孩子应该建造更好的世界，应该和不一样的卡梅拉一样，那样就没有谁再能够统治他们了。不一样的卡梅拉 2岁以上。勇于追求。我爸爸 2岁以上。绘本。看后我哭了。想念我的爸爸。 小玻翻翻书0-1岁。翻翻书的形式适合孩子。简单而且大的图案比较适合这个阶段的宝宝。好饿的毛毛虫棕色的熊，棕色的熊，你在看什么 这两本绘本书适合1岁左右的孩子，熊是双语的，英文朗朗上口，适合孩子认识颜色。经典作者。李欧的绘本都值得买。美丽的数学 这是日本的绘本，非常非常美，难度不一，从加减法到高深的数学概念，精品。非常美。用非常清晰的方式解释了数学。多希望能出100本！可惜只有5本。地上100层，地下100层 日本的绘本，数数，科普妙想科学 有趣的简单的方式介绍了科学，孩子一定会喜欢的。精品。适合幼儿园和小学低年级阶段。噼里啪啦 翻翻书系列。有趣的翻翻书，适合1-2岁的孩子爱丽丝奇境漫游记 立体书 设计的非常好，就是贵。中文打过折要80. 买了英文版的。有条件值得给孩子收藏一本。能培养孩子的创造力。霍顿听到了呼呼的声音 3岁以上。 深刻温柔的灵魂。我一定给孩子读。绿鸡蛋和火腿 这本书和上一本霍顿都是享誉世界的苏斯博士的书，这本的英文非常之有趣，又简单又有趣，笑死人了。有一点点英语基础的孩子可以给买。全书只有50个单词，爆笑的故事一定要用英文读，才有效果。天才苏斯博士的作品！英语词汇乐翻天 适合初中，高中孩子。 漫画风格类似父与子。用漫画的方式学英语单词，太棒了！简直太喜欢了。我真是羡慕我的宝贝了！希望她快点长大！还有一些好的绘本 花婆婆 猜猜我有多爱你 花城 鼠小弟系列 经典 幽默的方式让孩子理解概念 比如大和小 适合1岁以上。
宝宝现在是1岁2个月了。看的最多的是棕色的熊，棕色的熊，你在看什么，还有好饿的毛毛虫。棕色的熊简单，很久以前就能看懂了，现在书已经翻烂了。好饿的毛毛虫上个月给他放网上搜到的视频的时候，她忽然乐了，因为看到毛毛虫从蛋里蹦出来，然后吃大苹果啊呜啊呜的，她看懂了。很开心！几乎每天都要看一遍视频，对照书看。有本《小洞的故事》她也是很久之前就喜欢看了，大约九个月的时候最合适，因为那个时候孩子喜欢用手指头戳洞洞，看到最后一页的时候她总是去找自己的肚脐眼。《彩虹色的花》她现在也喜欢看，就是看看图，也不太明白。《我爸爸》是她的钟爱之一，图大，容易看，她可能也懂了一些，经常要我给她读。从1岁左右就开始看了。噼里啪啦还有一套佐佐木洋子的书，质量和内容很不错，是翻翻书，朋友送的，她现在还不是很感兴趣，估计还需要再大一两个月看明白。</text>

<summary_trans>Book recommended to children after actual purchase</summary_trans><text_trans>First recommend some good books for your child. The standard of my book selection is a book that enhances children's creativity, making children more free, happier, stronger and better, rather than improving their academic performance. My child is now 7 months, I have bought her a few The box book is kept. You have to believe that I recommend classics. But maybe not some books that are practical. I think that it is most important for children to develop into healthy people. Our children should build a better world, and they should be the same as different Camela, so no one can rule them anymore. Not the same Camela 2 years old or older. Be brave in pursuit. My father is over 2 years old. Picture book. I cried after watching. Miss my dad. Xiaobo flips through the book 0-1 years old. The form of the flip book is suitable for children. Simple and large patterns are more suitable for this stage of the baby. Hungry caterpillar brown bear, brown bear, what are you looking at? These two books are suitable for children around the age of one. The bear is bilingual and the English is catchy, suitable for children to know the color. Classic author. Leo's picture books are worth buying. Beautiful mathematics This is a Japanese picture book, very beautiful, difficult, from addition and subtraction to advanced mathematical concepts, boutique. very beautiful. Explain mathematics in a very clear way. I hope to have 100 copies! Unfortunately, there are only 5 books. 100 floors above ground, 100 floors underground. Japanese picture books, counting, science and science science. Interesting and simple way to introduce science, children will love it. Boutique. Suitable for kindergarten and elementary school in the lower grades.噼里啪啦翻翻书系列. Interesting flip book, suitable for 1-2 year old children Alice in Wonderland roaming book. The book is very good, it is expensive. Chinese has been over 80. I bought the English version. It is worthwhile to collect a copy for your child. Can cultivate children's creativity. Horton heard the voice of screaming over 3 years old. Deep and gentle soul. I must read it to my child. Green Eggs and Ham This book and the previous Horton are the world-famous Dr. Sousse's book. This English is very interesting, simple and fun, and laughs. A child with a little English foundation can buy it. There are only 50 words in the book, and the story of hilarious reading must be read in English. The work of Dr. Sousse! English vocabulary is suitable for junior high school, high school children. The comic style is similar to the father and the child. It’s great to learn English words in comics! I really like it too much. I really envy my baby! I hope she will grow up soon! There are some good picture books, flower mother-in-law, guess how much I love you, flower city, mouse brother series, classic humor, let children understand concepts such as big and small, suitable for more than 1 year old.
The baby is now 1 year and 2 months old. The most seen are the brown bears, the brown bears, what are you looking at, and the hungry caterpillars. The brown bear is simple and can be understood long time ago. Now the book has been ruined. When the hungry caterpillar gave him a video on the Internet last month, she suddenly became happy, because she saw the caterpillars licking out of the egg, and then eating a big apple, oh yeah, she understood. Very happy! Look at the video almost every day, look at the book. There is this "Small Cave Story". She also liked it a long time ago. It is most suitable for about nine months, because at that time, the child likes to poke the hole with his finger. When she sees the last page, she always looks for it. Your own belly button. "Iridescent Flower" she also likes to watch now, just look at the picture, and do not quite understand. "My Dad" is one of her favorite, the picture is big, easy to see, she may also understand some, often want me to read to her. I started watching it from around 1 year old. There is also a set of books by Sasaki Yoko. The quality and content are very good. It is a flip book and a friend. She is not very interested now. It is estimated that it will take another month or two to understand.</text_trans></item>

<text>从来没有到网上买过图书，这是第一次，也因为我们这里书店没有卖这个书的。没办法，只好一试了。不过很担心，怕回来的书是盗版的，担心看不清楚等等。
8月10日定购的，8月23日到的，书不错，很满意。和在书店里买到的一样好。就是快递的速度太慢了，如果送货的速度再快一点儿就更好了！非常感谢卓越网卓越亚马逊，给我提供了这么好的渠道。</text>

<summary_trans>About purchasing books</summary_trans><text_trans>I have never bought a book online, this is the first time, and because our bookstore does not sell this book. No way, I had to try it. However, I am very worried that I am afraid that the book I came back to is pirated, I am afraid I can’t see it clearly.
Ordered on August 10, arrived on August 23, the book is good, very satisfied. As good as what I bought in the bookstore. The speed of the express is too slow, if the delivery speed is a little faster, it will be even better! I am very grateful to Joyo.com for providing me with such a good channel.</text_trans></item>

<summary>平实的内心</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>其实之前受到川端康成的影响，觉得日本文化的细腻实在是属于一个岛国的小气，我是读不下去日本文学的。可是，当老婆向我推荐这个作家的时候，我觉得，是不是读读也没事儿的。不好的话就扔掉呗，就是嘛。
从亚马逊拿到之后，简简单单的设计，我喜欢的设计装帧方式。读一读，觉得，村上这个人还真是能够坚持自己。他说，我大致是一个小说家，所以有自己坚持的生活方式，虽然这种方式不大讨一些朋友欢喜。那也罢了，总有得失的。大意如此吧，村上这个作家看起来很淡定，喜欢这样的作家。这样的作家写出来的文章字里行间透露出一股平静，那才是人阅读时必须感受得到的氛围，否则算什么阅读呢？以后会慢慢看村上的书。期待他继续写出来这样的好书。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Plain heart</summary_trans><text_trans>In fact, before being influenced by Kawabata Yasunari, I felt that the delicateness of Japanese culture really belongs to the sting of an island country. I can't read Japanese literature. However, when my wife recommended this writer to me, I feel that it is okay to read it. If you are not good, throw away your cockroaches, that is.
After getting it from Amazon, it's simple design, I like the design of the binding method. After reading it, I feel that this person in Murakami is really able to stick to himself. He said that I am roughly a novelist, so I have a lifestyle that I insist on, although this method does not appeal to some friends to rejoice. That's all, there are always gains and losses. To the effect of this, Murakami’s writer looks very calm and likes such a writer. Such an article written by such a writer reveals a calm between the lines, which is the atmosphere that people must feel when reading, otherwise what is reading? I will slowly read the books from the village in the future. I look forward to his continued writing of such a good book.</text_trans></item>

<text>我是很热爱旅游的人，所以也爱看旅行的书，此书很多网友推荐，买后很久今天才看完这本书。看的很累，照片都不错，但过于文学性和情调化的写法实在是让人有些看不下去。很怀疑当你旅行的时候真的能想到那么多吗？那么多的文化，那么多的感想喷射而出，洒满纸张，却让我感受不到每一个地点的真实内容。特别是对于日本的描绘，通篇的村上春树读后感。我想看的是旅行的观感，而不是读书笔记。</text>

With so many cultures, so many feelings are ejected and covered with paper, but I can't feel the real content of every place. Especially for the portrayal of Japan, I read the story of Haruki Murakami. What I want to see is the look and feel of travel, not reading notes.</text_trans></item>

<text>对喜欢看宋的货币系列的人而言，一定是一个阴谋论的喜爱者，一定相信这个世界上有许多躲在后面操控世界赚大钱的混蛋，他们整天想着对付伟大的中国。
但是，最简单的逻辑，这个人或者团体是谁呢？美林？摩根斯坦利？高盛？还是早就没落的罗斯柴尔德家族？
如果存在这样的团体，那么他们早应该富甲天下了，那么他们在哪里呢？
如果宋先生早就明白了赚钱的道理，那他也应该有很多赚钱的门路吧？
那为什么他在宏源证券不能成功呢？
为什么他最后还是靠写书赚钱呢？
想让自己生活的美好一些，有空还是看看关于投资大师如巴菲特、彼得林奇之类的书籍吧，起码能让你有所收获。</text>

They must believe that there are many bastards in the world who are hiding behind the world to make big money. They think about dealing with the great China all day long.
But the simplest logic, who is this person or group? Merrill Lynch? Morgan Stanley? Goldman Sachs? Or the Rothschild family that has long since fallen?
If there is such a group, then they should have been rich in the world, so where are they?
If Mr. Song has long understood the truth of making money, then he should have a lot of money to make money.
Then why is he not successful in Hongyuan Securities?
Why did he finally make money by writing books?

<text>看了这本小说之后，脑中反复出现这句话“谁的佳期，谁如梦”。
其实故事的情节很平淡，唯一出彩的大概是男主对待爱情的那种奋不顾身的态度
现代小说，要想有一个好的口碑，内容无需精彩，但男主必须是为爱不顾一切的</text>

<summary_trans>Who is the best, who is like a dream?</summary_trans><text_trans>After reading this novel, the phrase "Who's a good time, who is like a dream" appears repeatedly in the brain.
In fact, the plot of the story is very dull. The only thing that shines is probably the kind of attitude that the male owner treats love.
Modern novels, if you want to have a good reputation, the content does not need to be wonderful, but the male must be desperate for love.</text_trans></item>

Finally, this book inspires us to invest in risk funds, save money, and ultimately always for pensions, pensions must be more than 6 million?

<text>中州古籍的书，都不错。版面设计到内容，简洁大方！不花哨。个人比较欣赏。毕竟质量好，价格也许稍贵一点点。但是有很严重的问题，这本书注释的很差劲儿，而且竟然把原序置其后，可见对原作者不尊重，不但如此，注释有失偏颇，足见其人功底不深。买到手后，只看了原文，注释部分舍弃了。本着对大家负责的态度，在这里说明一下，这本书质量绝对好。但内容不怎么样。建议大家考虑下其它出版社的吧！</text>

After all, the quality is good, the price may be a bit more expensive. However, there are serious problems. The book is very poorly commented, and even if the original order is placed behind it, it can be seen that the original author is not respectful. Not only that, but the comments are biased, which shows that the merits are not deep. After buying the hand, I only looked at the original text, and the comment part was discarded. In the attitude of being responsible to everyone, here is a description of the quality of this book is absolutely good. But the content is not good.

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>本人不喜欢这个故事。介绍还说这是辛夷坞唯一一部不悲伤的暖伤作品。可见这个作者其它故事有多么的悲伤。这个作者的其它小说我都不会买的了。我不喜欢悲剧。所以，辛夷坞的粉丝不要攻击我，每个人都有自己喜欢的标准，我不喜欢也不代表这本小说不好，只是不符合我喜欢的标准而已。我喜欢的是【温馨有爱浪漫】的故事，在《原来》我完全看不到，还有悲伤，有遗憾，有不满。我想起网上的一句话“只要结局是美好的，过程你让我怎么哭都可以”。我觉得这句话说得不错。但是我看《原来》，过程找不到笑点，结局也找不到美好，完全不是我喜欢的类型，看完内心还很不舒服。所以不喜欢。有两本书，一本是《原来你还在这里》一本是《原来》。我看完《原来你还在这里》都不想看《原来》。内容都差不多，只是故事的顺序不同。</text>

It can be seen how sad the other stories of this author are. I won't buy any of the author's other novels. I don't like tragedy. Therefore, fans of Xinyiwu don't attack me. Everyone has their own favorite standards. I don't like it or mean that this novel is not good, but it doesn't meet the standards I like. What I like is the story of [warm and romantic). I can't see it in "The Original", there are sadness, regret, and dissatisfaction. I think of a sentence on the Internet, "As long as the ending is good, you can make me cry." I think this sentence is quite good. But I read "The original", the process can not find a smile, the ending can not find a good, is not the type I like, it is very uncomfortable after reading the heart. So don't like it. There are two books, one is "You are still here" and one is "The Original". I didn't want to read "The Original" after reading "I am still here." The content is similar, but the order of the stories is different.</text_trans></item>

<summary>以西方证中国</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>在中国的文化传统里，一向有诚敬、守拙之说，大约古人早就意识到了：欲望无限，生命有限，以有限追无限，殆矣。不过，在年轻的时候，是不太信这些的，觉得这是老气横秋的陈儒之说，人生无限好，干嘛要自我设限。随着年龄的增长，渐渐地发现了自己的有限，而且是越来越有限。这本《意志力》是从西方心理学的角度，证实了人这一凡胎肉体的各种有限。比如说，人的精力有限，所以，一段时间只做一件重要的事情，千万不要做两件。这个看起来很简单的道理，对于我是有颠覆性的，以前老认为自己是无所不能的，可以同时推进多个目标。而且，这个观点了印证了我一向推崇的中国传统文化中的若干观点；观西方心理学之观点，证中国传统之智慧，不亦快哉。</text>

<summary_trans>Western China</summary_trans><text_trans>In the cultural traditions of China, there has always been a sincere respect and observance. The ancients have long realized that there is boundless desire, limited life, and limited infinity. However, when I was young, I didn’t believe it. I think this is the old-fashioned Chen Ruzhi’s saying that life is infinitely good, why do you want to set limits yourself. As I grew older, I gradually found myself limited and more and more limited. This "willpower" is a confirmation of the limited nature of human beings from the perspective of Western psychology. For example, people have limited energy, so only do one important thing for a while, don't do two. This seemingly simple truth is subversive to me. I used to think that I am omnipotent and can advance multiple goals at the same time. Moreover, this view confirms several viewpoints in the traditional Chinese culture that I have always admired; the view of Western psychology and the wisdom of Chinese tradition are not fast.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Quite satisfied</summary_trans><text_trans>Because many readers on the Internet have responded to the various versions of the three-character scriptures, they have not started. This is a book that I have been looking for for a long time, and I am basically satisfied. I probably got a bit of it and found a few places where the phonetic has its source. 2 pages, do not teach "no", marked as 4 sounds, but because the accent should read 2 sounds; 38 pages of a "one" of the universe, marked as 1 sound, but because the accent should read 4 sounds; 59 pages The "legacy" of the human remains is marked as yi, 2 sounds, should read wei, 4 sounds, gifts and so on. From the 40-page "North-South Mixed" to the 45-page "Reading the History", this paragraph is different from what I found online. Later, Baidu said: "Three Character Classics" is a rare legacy of our country, with different Version, full text counts range from 1120 words to 1722 words. This piece will not be carefully read.

First of all, as a Chinese with such a social status in the United States, the degree of reference for her growth experience is debatable. In addition, the Chinese translation of the broth is really like the orange of the season, it looks like no. taste. From the beginning to the end of the first chapter, I didn't see where she inspired the reader, or told the question that was worth thinking about, but it was like continually flaunting how good her performance was. What readers value is not how successful you are, those you can get to the awards show, what we expect to see is what we can learn from your growth experience! This kind of bad language, lack of thought fast food books, it is really not worth reading, reading is just a waste of time and money. No wonder that when I saw the bookstore, I didn’t open the book.

可是孩子小的时候，分辨力不是很强，我们家长的意识也是逐渐才形成。发现这种书对孩子想象力有一种束缚作用。孩子喜欢画车、近半年来画了很多的公共汽车、火车，但与这本书上的画大同小异，没有了可喜的想象力的发挥，失去了儿童画的精彩。

<summary_trans>Don't mislead your child</summary_trans><text_trans>The content of the book is very comprehensive. Children also like it.
However, when the child is young, the resolution is not very strong, and the consciousness of our parents is gradually formed. Found that this book has a restraining effect on the child's imagination. Children like to paint cars, and they have painted a lot of buses and trains in the past six months, but they are similar to the paintings on this book. They have no fascinating imagination and have lost the excitement of children's paintings.
It is recommended to indicate the side effects of the book in a conspicuous place, or to apply to the child's age range.</text_trans></item>

The reason why I only say "like" piracy is because the watermark of the title page is half of the watermark, and half of it is stamped...

Then, the whole dictionary is like water, and the paper is wavy as a whole, especially like the water, the tide, and the dry.
The corners of the hard shell are also worn and more powerful...
Who will tell me if I have spent more than 70 pieces of the dictionary to buy it? Is it genuine? If he is pirated, then other pirates sell for more than a dozen dollars. This makes me feel awkward...</text_trans></item>

It is more like a simple and simple essay. Some parts of the language are messy. Because Liu Chang does not have full travel. Journey, so his trip is not likely to be written as full. Excessive is a self-imposed thought or a modified essay in life. The correction does not seem to be very deep enough. From the language point of view, it can be seen that the language is not very good when I was a child.

<summary>民国语文最好的选本</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这一套两本书，是目前所知民国语文最好的选本，短小精悍、要言不烦、生动有趣、寓教于乐。
从这些文章中，可以看到老一辈教育家们真的是懂得教育的规律性；从这些文章中，依稀可见朱自清、王鼎
钧、胡适、张爱玲、三毛等作家文章的端倪和风韵。
单纯地谈语文教育，意义不大。没有制度的改善，就不会有大的改观。
至少这套书可以作为成人的一个参照；孩子的一个开端。学习真正的国语，就看看这套书吧！
热烈推荐！！！</text>

<summary_trans>The best selection of Chinese language</summary_trans><text_trans>This set of two books is the best selection of the language of the Republic of China. It is short and succinct, not annoying, lively and interesting, and entertaining.
From these articles, we can see that the older generation of educators really understand the regularity of education; from these articles, Zhu Ziqing and Wang Ding are faintly visible.
The clues and charms of writers such as 钧, Hu Shi, Zhang Ailing, and San Mao.
Simply talking about language education is of little significance. Without a system improvement, there will be no major changes.
At least this set of books can be used as a reference for adults; a beginning for children. Learn the real Mandarin, just take a look at this set of books!

<summary>有些失望</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>原本很期待，但拿到东西后比较失望。
文字很少，用2，3小时足以全部读完内容。全书书页50%左右是照片和诗式的文字，即便是没有图片的纯文字页，每页的上面三分之一都是空白。这样算来要是没有文字和空白正常排版，205页的书也就只有100页左右的内容。这可能是名人著书的惯用做法，看似很诗意很文艺，但读者要看的是文字，要看图片就直接买写真去了。单说作者文笔，有一定功力。只是这样的书我不愿花钱再买。</text>

The amount is also a lot, which plays the role of knowledge integration and method penetration. It is better than the basic questions. It allows us to experience the use of mathematics. It is still very good. If there are some mathematics learning skills, it is better. I think we must learn well. Mathematics, it is inevitable to do more problems, familiar with the problem-solving ideas of various types of questions. At the beginning, we should start with the basic questions, take the exercises on the textbook as the standard, practice and lay the foundations repeatedly, and then find some extracurricular exercises to help develop ideas, improve their analytical and solving skills, and master the general rules of solving problems. Of course, these are all learned in Li Xiaopeng's Sina blog. The blogger used to be a college entrance examination champion. By studying the methods in the blog, my mathematics thinking ability has also improved and the mathematics learning can be used freely. Now I look at the learning methods in the blog and combine this book to learn. The combination of the two, my mathematics scores improve quickly, I believe that when I take the college entrance examination, I will be able to achieve better results, and everyone will cheer.

这本书适合急需一些美丽句子来装点门面的人。</text>

Explain a point, especially the one that is quite unique. You have to explain why it is like this, rather than simply squatting it there. However, there is a lot of empty talk in this book.
This book is suitable for people who need some beautiful sentences to decorate the facade.</text_trans></item>

For those who are ready to work in a foreign-funded enterprise, it can be used as a simple psychological prevention book, but if you have already thought about some inspiration for many years of work, it is better to look at the biography of foreign companies.
The work styles and methods of foreign-funded enterprises are similar. Whether in the consulting industry or the fast-moving consumer goods industry, they are efficient, precise, respectful and obedient. The working methods and skills books are not clearly explained.</text_trans></item>

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>王道乾的这个译文一直是译林出版社各个版本沿用下来的，是1985年就一译出来的。且不说即使是原文，外国文学的表达与中国文学本来就不同，单单是相隔了两个年代，21世纪的中国的语言文字表达也与过往大大不同了……大家就别苛求这个版本的译文艰涩难懂了。而且本来杜拉斯的写的情节大部分是在时空中穿梭，带点跳跃，原来看着是现在，谁知又引出某个跟她看似无关的女人的描写，看了两页才回到刚刚。她的比喻，隐喻也是很吊诡的，有时就如文中其中一段：“我使得全程充满了大街上那种女乞丐，流落在各个城市的乞丐，散布在乡间稻田里的穷女人……是从我……衍化而来，她来自各处……”这日子里，“我”和“情人”等待着分离，这个“女人”被穿插着描述，这些笔墨，旨在形容她在这段爱情中只是“流浪”没有“归宿”……她的比喻不是简单一句两句话，是动辄用数千字来比喻她那刻的感受，看似艰涩冗长，但系仔细读懂，是能烙进读者的心里的。
建议，看这本书，最好在僻静的房内，没有太多嘈杂，甚至舒缓的音乐也不要，这个故事，不需要外力煽动感情。</text>

<summary_trans>Objectively speaking~</summary_trans><text_trans>This translation of Wang Daoqian has been used by various versions of Yilin Publishing House and was translated in 1985. Not to mention that even if it is the original text, the expression of foreign literature is different from that of Chinese literature. It is only two years apart. The Chinese language expression in the 21st century is much different from the past... Don’t demand this version of the translation. Hard to understand. Moreover, most of the plots written by Duras were in the air and time, with a little jump. The original look is now, who knows that it also leads to a description of a woman who seems to have nothing to do with her. just. Her metaphor, metaphor is also very condolence, sometimes as one of the paragraphs in the text: "I made the whole process full of the son-in-law on the street, the hustle and bustle of the cities, the poor women scattered in the country rice fields... from me ......Derived, she comes from all over the place..." In this day, "I" and "lover" are waiting for separation. This "woman" is interspersed with descriptions. These inks are intended to describe her in this love. "Wandering" does not have "homesickness"... Her metaphor is not a simple sentence or two sentences. It is a metaphor for thousands of words to compare her feelings at that moment. It seems to be difficult and long, but it is carefully read and can be branded into readers. In my heart.
It is recommended to read this book, preferably in a secluded room, without too much noisy, or even soothing music. This story does not require external force to incite emotions.</text_trans></item>

这本书印刷精美，作者(或者译者)文笔很好，但是缺乏实用性，有谁能在遇到灾难的时候捧着这样一本书看呢？而且书中叙述并不简练，情急之下很难找到想要的内容。

The book is beautifully printed, and the author (or translator) has a good writing style, but it lacks practicality. Who can hold such a book in the event of a disaster? Moreover, the narrative in the book is not concise, and it is difficult to find what you want in an emergency.
The same kind of books personally recommend the "US Army Survival Manual", which is superior in practicality.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>very bad</summary_trans><text_trans>The writing is very general! It is said that Zhu Ziqing is too high, I believe that it is only for the best-selling bibliography to use Zhu Ziqing. The whole process of self-talking and self-destruction is a heavy and ethereal, but in fact, the nonsense of nonsense can not be called a prose! People can't invest, and the whole book is written in Japan. This is a Taiwanese's feelings about Japan. I bought this book because I wrote my father's love, but the introverted and magnificent words of the father's love must not be used as a slogan for recommending books. To be a good book about fatherly love, like "back view" is worth using. The word father love is pushed to everyone and is very popular. This book is really not recommended!</text_trans></item>

<text>这本书是外国历史学家黑尔的博士论文改编的，书的绝大多数部分都是些太平天国运动的，只是从侧面描写了一些曾国藩，用词都是非常客观的，但也就是绝对的客观，使得看完这本书后还是对曾国藩没有多少了解，倒是对太平天国运动留下了很深的印象。
  我写这个评论是在完完整整的看完这本书后给予的评价，可能这本书只适合在了解了曾国藩后再来补充吧，像我这样初次了解曾国藩的人不太适合。

<summary_trans>This book does not conform to the reading habits of the Chinese people, or it must be renamed "The Death of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom"</summary_trans><text_trans>This book is adapted from the foreign historian Hale's doctoral thesis. Most of the book is about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement. It only describes some Zeng Guofan from the side. The words are very objective, but they are absolute. Objectively, after reading this book, I still don’t know much about Zeng Guofan, but I left a deep impression on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement.
  I wrote this commentary after the complete reading of this book. Maybe this book is only suitable for adding Zeng Guofan after the book is added. People like me who know Zeng Guofan for the first time are not suitable.

<text>表示也是冲着这个译本来的。可是在网上看封面貌似是个硬皮 没想到皮这么软哇擦泪 而且书的风格属于畅销书的模式 一点都没有尊重经典的样子 而是草草了事 整个一塌糊涂
就这种装帧原价还能定将近三十我擦勒 我觉得二十块足以
还有这本书 就红与黑这部小说 建议在书店里看觉得对胃口了再考虑买
将近一个月 看了141页 终于看不下去了 读起来觉得很累（希望不是译本的问题） 很没有头绪感 有奥斯丁作品的冗长“细致” 和法国文学的现实性和传奇性 同时也极富哲理味道（每一章的引子） 但文字组织能力我觉得Stendhal稍欠火候 一团乱麻 读起来令人觉得很不愉快 同样的题材巴尔扎克写的感觉（即《高老头》 一个学生拉斯蒂涅走向上流社会的故事）就比这个棒很多 比这个流畅得多 刻画人物也更宏观更有力
不希望听到一些人自以为是地说我修养不够什么的 修养不够的人不看这类书
慎重考虑之！觉得这十三块五有点浪费的意味了。</text>

<summary_trans>Gray is often not satisfied</summary_trans><text_trans>The expression is also directed at this translation. However, looking at the cover on the Internet seems to be a hard skin. I didn't expect the skin to be so soft, and the style of the book is a bestseller. I don't respect the classics at all, but I have to work out the whole mess.
In this kind of binding, the original price can still be nearly 30. I think 20 pieces are enough.
And this book, the novel about red and black, I suggest that I feel that I have an appetite in the bookstore and then consider buying it.
I have seen 141 pages in the past month and finally can't stand it. I feel very tired when I read it. (I hope it is not a translation.) I have no clue. The lengthy "detail" of Austen's works and the reality and legend of French literature are also extremely Rich philosophy taste (introduction of each chapter) But the text organization ability I think Stendhal is a little ignorant, and it is very unpleasant to read. The same subject Balzac writes the feeling (ie "Old Man", a student Rastie The story of Nie to the upper class) is much more powerful than this one.
I don’t want to hear people who are self-righteous and say that I am not enough to cultivate.
Think carefully! I feel that these thirteen pieces are a bit wasteful.</text_trans></item>

<summary>一次幸运</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>以前觉得哲学是抽象晦涩难懂的，很少涉猎这一方面的知识。但是认真的看了半本书后，整个思想有种被洗礼的感觉，一个人最重要的是认识自己，一个成功的人最成功的事也就是完美了自己，因为你做了别人没做过也做不到的事。能买到这本书让我认为是件很幸运的事。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Lucky once</summary_trans><text_trans>I used to think that philosophy is abstract and difficult to understand, and I rarely learn about it. But after carefully reading half of the book, the whole idea has a feeling of being baptized. The most important thing for a person is to know oneself. The most successful thing for a successful person is to perfect himself, because you have done it before. Can't do anything. I can buy this book and I think it is a very lucky thing.</text_trans></item>

<summary>孩子能懂吗?</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>不知道是翻译的问题还是原作本就这样.
对于孩子们幼稚的问题,这些大科学家文学家们给出的回答太深奥而且冗长.单就听完或者看完长篇的解释,恐怕对里面的解释性的术语还没有来得及消化,就早已经忘了是在解释什么问题了.
编辑或者作者把问题归类了:物理学的便由物理学家回答,化学的便由化学家回答......但是太过专业反倒是把简单的问题弄得迷糊了.
生活中大人们对孩子这些突发的问题反倒有更巧妙合适的回答和化解,比这本书好多了....</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Can the child understand?</summary_trans><text_trans>I don't know if it is a translation problem or the original work.
For the childish problems of the children, the answers given by these great scientists and writers are too esoteric and lengthy. After listening to or reading the long explanations, I am afraid that the explanatory terms in them have not been digested yet. It is explaining what the problem is.
The editor or the author categorizes the problem: the physics is answered by the physicist, and the chemistry is answered by the chemist... but being too professional is confusing the simple question.
Adults in life have more clever and appropriate answers and solutions to these sudden problems of children, which is much better than this book....</text_trans></item>

<text>因为没有读过其他版本的  所以不说比较的话  就这个版本而已  措辞太文艺  作者自己用文字做了很多修饰和添加  有点失真  书中反复说到林微因跟3个男人的感情纠葛  其实有点过于罗嗦  虽然林的感情经历亦是传奇  但实在不用这么强调  总的来说  读完大概了解了林微因这个人的生平  只是文字并没有如当初期待的那样有触动！~</text>

<summary_trans>After reading</summary_trans><text_trans>Because I haven't read other versions, I don't say any comparison. This version has been worded too. The literary author himself has made a lot of modifications and added a little distortion in the text. The book repeatedly said that Lin Wei’s emotional entanglement with three men is actually a bit too Although Lin’s emotional experience is also legendary, I really don’t need to emphasize that in general, after reading it, I probably understand that Lin Wei’s life is just that the text is not as touching as I expected it! ~</text_trans></item>

<summary>大陆版和台湾版的区别（译文对比）</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>截取两段，对比一下两个版本（大陆许金声 和 台湾廖世昌）的翻译。
至于翻译的精准度，读者自己判断，我个人更倾向于廖世昌。
片段一：
第一个版本（许金声翻译，即为本书）
问：我们将从创世大爆炸本身开始论述，接着再描绘出从物质到生命，再从生命到心智（mind）的进化过程。然后，我们将考察随着心智或者说是人类意识的出现，人类进化的五个或六个主要时期。而且，所有这一切都是放置在一种灵性（spirituality）的背景之中的：也就是说，灵性的含义，它在历史上曾经采取的各种不同的形式，以及在今后可能采取的形式。是这样的吗？
肯·威尔伯：是的，这是一种关于万事万物历史的简要的论述。这听起来有一点冠冕堂皇，但却是建立在我称之为“定位概括”（orien-ting generalizations）的基础之上的，这种“定位概括”极大地简化了所有事物。
第二个版本（廖世昌翻译，台湾版）
問：我們的故事從「宇宙大爆炸」（the Big Bang）開始，然後從物質到生命再到心智，如此追溯整個演化過程。隨著心智或是人類意識的浮現，我們將探討人類演化的五、六個階段。但這一切都要放在靈性（spirituality）的脈絡、靈性的意義、歷史上的靈修傳承採取過的種種形式，以及未來可能採取的形式來談才可以。我說的對嗎？
威：沒錯，這差不多就是一部萬物史綱了。聽起來很龐大，但其實是奠基在我所謂的「定位歸納」（orienting generalizations）這個原理之上的。定位歸納大大簡化了整件事情。
片段二：
第一个版本（许金声翻译，即为本书）
最初，人类并未形成任何形式的道德体系：这是“前习俗”时期。在这之后，人类得到了一种普遍的道德体系，这种道德体系代表他们所处社会的基本价值：这是“传统”时期。随着进一步的发展，个人可以反思他（或她）所处的社会，与之拉开一定的适度的距离，有一种能力去批评或改革它：这种个人在一定程度上就是“后传统”的了。
第二个版本（廖世昌翻译，台湾版）
人出生時尚未社會化，也還沒有進入任何道德體制。這是他的「前成規」（preconventional）期。後來，人在自己成長的社會裡開始學習其道德體制。這個道德體制代表的是他那個社會的基本價值觀。這時他開始進入「成規」（conventional）期。接著個體如果繼續成

<summary_trans>The difference between the mainland version and the Taiwan version (translation comparison)</summary_trans><text_trans>Take two paragraphs and compare the translations of the two versions (Continental Xu Jinsheng and Taiwan Liao Shichang).
As for the accuracy of translation, readers judge themselves, I personally prefer Liao Shichang.
Fragment one:
The first version (Xu Jinsheng translation, which is the book)
Question: We will start with the Big Bang itself, and then describe the evolution from material to life and then from life to mind. Then, we will examine five or six major periods of human evolution as the mind or human consciousness emerges. Moreover, all of this is placed in a context of spirituality: that is, the meaning of spirituality, the different forms it has taken in history, and the forms that may be taken in the future. Is that so?
Ken Wilbur: Yes, this is a brief discussion of the history of everything. It sounds a bit of a grandiose, but it is based on what I call "orien-ting generalizations", which greatly simplifies everything.
The second version (Liao Shichang translation, Taiwan version)
Q: Our story begins with the Big Bang and then goes from matter to life to the mind, so it traces the entire evolution. With the emergence of mind or people, we will explore the five or six stages of human evolution. But all this must be placed in the context of spirituality, the meaning of defamatoryness, the various forms adopted in the history of cultivating and inheritance, and the possible form of talks that may be taken. Am I right?
Wei: Yes, this is almost a history of all things. It sounds huge, but it is actually based on what I call the principle of "orienting generalizations". Positioning induction greatly simplifies the whole thing.
Fragment two:
The first version (Xu Jinsheng translation, which is the book)
Initially, humans did not form any form of moral system: this is the "pre-custom" period. After that, human beings have a universal moral system that represents the basic value of the society in which they live: this is the “traditional” period. With further development, an individual can reflect on the society in which he or she lives, and open a certain distance from it. There is a ability to criticize or reform it: this individual is to some extent a “post-tradition” It’s gone.
The second version (Liao Shichang translation, Taiwan version)
People were not socialized at the time of birth, and they have not yet entered any moral system. This is his "preconventional" period. Later, people began to learn their moral system in their own growing society. This moral system represents the basic values ​​of his society. At this time he began to enter the "conventional" period. Then the individual continues to
Long, you will begin to reflect on your own society, maintain a distance from society, and have the ability to criticize or reform society. At this time he entered the postconventional period.</text_trans></item>

<summary>书不能这么编！</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>作者将自己的文章、介绍德兰修女（特蕾莎嬷嬷）的文章，以及德兰修女自己的文章混杂在一起，署名与目录均无反映。让人弄不清哪一篇是华姿的，哪一篇是德兰修女的，哪一篇是选摘的，给读者造成极大的阅读障碍，而且极度败坏阅读情绪。作者在后记中还很有限地承认引用了巴克莱博士的文字，但其实是：作者在自己的文章里大段大段引用巴克莱博士的《新约圣经注释》，有的文章几乎完全是《新约圣经注释》的抄录！
其实，实在说，作者的文笔很美，而且因为基督情感的影响，让文章有了另一重一般书籍难以比拟的润泽心灵的温度，但是既然如此，又何必这么做呢？你的文章好，但我们是冲着德兰修女才买的！将几种文章分开编排不好吗？而且根本不会影响到销量啊？
作者这么做，让一本好书变得不伦不类，给读者造成了很大的麻烦和伤害，也让人怀疑作者信仰的纯净和真诚，同时对于德兰修女崇高的精神和高贵的文字也构成了严重的干扰和污染！</text>

<summary_trans>Books can't be edited like this!</summary_trans><text_trans>The authors mixed their articles, the articles about Mother Teresa (Teresa), and the articles of Mother Teresa, and the signatures and catalogues were not reflected. It is unclear which one is Huazi, which one is Sister Delan, and which one is selected, which causes great dyslexia for readers and extremely derogates reading emotions. In the postscript, the author also confessed to the quotation of Dr. Barclays's text, but it is actually: the author quoted Dr. Barclays' New Testament Notes in a large section of his own article, and some articles are almost entirely " Transcription of the New Testament Notes!
In fact, it is true that the author's writing is very beautiful, and because of the influence of Christ's emotions, the article has another temperature that is incomparable to ordinary books, but why should it be done? Your article is good, but we bought it for Sister Delan! Is it not good to separate several articles? And it will not affect sales at all?
By doing this, the author makes a good book non-negligible, causing great trouble and harm to the readers. It also makes people doubt the purity and sincerity of the author's beliefs. At the same time, it also constitutes the noble spirit and noble words of Mother Teresa. Serious interference and pollution!</text_trans></item>

<text>可能各个孩子的阅读兴趣不一样.女儿8岁,我曾试着买了各种评价比较好的书,其中就包括这本球球老老鼠.大多数还是很喜欢的,就这本女儿刚看几页,就不想看了,再怎么劝也不看了,说不好看.所以笑猫系列的书我就不再买了.看看等她大点会不会又喜欢.倒是孙幼军的怪老头系列还蛮喜欢的,尤其是小猪唏哩呼噜系列,更是看得如痴如迷,一本等不到一本.后来我就买了孙幼军的一系列书.唯一感到不好的就是有些书书名不一样,可内容有部分是重复的.希望能发现更多的孩子真正喜欢的书,从一开始就培养起孩子的阅读爱好.</text>

It is the young man of Sun Youjun. The series is quite popular, especially the small pigs snoring series, but it is even more fascinating, one can not wait for one. Later I bought a series of books by Sun Youjun. The only thing that feels bad is that some The book name is different, but the content is partially duplicated.

The quality of the book pages is fine, with small posters inside. The poster is really small and may be slightly larger than the A4 paper.</text_trans></item>

<summary>一本好书</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>本书介绍了一个国家的经济与政治在发展过程中的内在联系。社会在发展过程中，会形成很多小团体和组织，这些团体和组织往往因为私利，成为了阻碍社会在经济等诸多领域的发展。由此，社会会僵化，市场经济不再灵活有效，社会财富分配也会趋于不合理，阶层间的矛盾进一步激化，阻碍国家的进步。
应该说本书的分析很鞭辟入里，但是由于本书的翻译不是特别符合中国人的阅读习惯，所以读起来需要慢慢咀嚼，细细消化。</text>

<summary_trans>a good book</summary_trans><text_trans>This book describes the intrinsic link between a country's economy and politics in the development process. In the process of development, society will form many small groups and organizations, which often become self-interested and hinder the development of society in many fields such as the economy. As a result, the society will become rigid, the market economy will no longer be flexible and effective, the distribution of social wealth will become unreasonable, and the contradictions between the classes will intensify and hinder the progress of the country.
It should be said that the analysis of this book is very confusing, but because the translation of this book is not particularly suitable for Chinese reading habits, it needs to be slowly chewed and digested.</text_trans></item>

　　适合上厕所无聊时候解闷儿。
　　看网上评价的天花烂坠又看了看目录，感觉貌似很有很容的样子，就买了一本，书送到时候翻开前面一堆不知道是哪个企业的一些好像是程序员的人写了一些乱七八糟的书评我就估计此书要悲剧。一小时的时间就能粗略的看了此书的1/3，因为此书实在是太没营养和内容了，根本不用思考什么就能快速的阅读，实在都懒得往厕所放了。
　　
　　电子工业出版社的书的要印刷质量还是不错，不过用在这种书上纯属浪费了。书虽然看起来很厚，其实没什么内容，跟排版有直接关系。。
　　
　　本书属于那种说了一大堆貌似很有道理但你看完之后有感觉他好像什么都没说。我实在很不理解这种书如何能获得如此高的评价⋯⋯</text>

Suitable for getting bored when going to the bathroom.
Look at the online evaluation of the smallpox and look at the catalogue, it feels very promising, I bought a book, when the book is delivered, I open a bunch of people who don’t know which company is a programmer. I wrote some inconspicuous book reviews and I estimated that this book is going to be a tragedy. I can roughly read 1/3 of this book in an hour, because this book is too nutritious and content, and I can read it quickly without thinking about anything. I really don't bother to go to the toilet.

The quality of the books of the Electronic Industry Press is still good, but it is a waste of use in such books. Although the book looks very thick, there is actually nothing to do with the typesetting. .

This book belongs to the kind that says a lot of looks seem to make sense. But after you read it, I feel that he doesn't seem to say anything. I really don't understand how this book can get such a high evaluation⋯⋯</text_trans></item>

<summary>交互设计领域重要著作！</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>本书的特点，总结起来大概有三点：
其一，气势恢宏，大局观尽收眼底。作者以其丰富的经验、惊人的洞察力和归纳能力，对交互设计进行了一次全方位的透视和反思。在设计这一大主题之下，多个相关领域当中的概念、理论和实践经验被串联了起来，让人读过之后有了荡气回肠的感觉和勇于把握大局观的气魄。
其二，旁征博引，大开眼界。任何领域都不是独立存在的，学科的交叉不可避免。作者旁征博引，把哲学、心理学、社会学、人类学等诸多领域中的概念、思想、人物和观点拿出来对比、类比、举例和批评，努力把设计范畴内各种相关信息在最恰当的时机展现给读者，一方面放手让读者自己去体味其中的涵意，另一方面又谨慎地用自己的观点来引导读者。其结果就是，读者被给予了足够丰富和有力的“思想武器”，可以与作者站在相同的高度，共同探讨设计的本质。
其三，观点鲜明，铿锵有力。对于设计，作者抱有更崇高的理想和愿景。作者在无情地批判了物质主义和消费主义的同时，用有说服力的论点和强烈的感情向读者高声呐喊，设计的抱负不应限于表面的浮华和花里胡哨的时尚。设计能够也应该做得更多，设计的终极目的是创造更美好的世界，设计师肩负着极其巨大的责任。
作者的大局观让我们脚踏在巨人肩上，高瞻远瞩。作者的旁征博引给了我们更多的阅读线索（比如我自己就忍不住去把作者引用过的《Citizen Designer》和《Cradle to Cradle》等书找来研读，且受益匪浅），并教会我们使用思辨的眼光看待事物。作者的鲜明观点不但发人深省，并且为我们指明了设计领域的发展方向。
无论是作为经验丰富的设计专家，还是作为传道、授业、解惑的教育者，作者通过本书给予了我们最宝贵的东西——智慧和思辨。</text>

<summary_trans>Important work in the field of interactive design!</summary_trans><text_trans>The characteristics of this book are summarized in three points:
First, the momentum is magnificent, and the overall situation is unobstructed. With his rich experience, amazing insight and inductive ability, the author has carried out a comprehensive perspective and reflection on interaction design. Under the theme of design, the concepts, theories, and practical experiences in a number of related fields have been concatenated, and people have experienced the feeling of stagnation and the courage to grasp the overall situation.
Second, the side of the levy, open eyes. No field exists independently, and the intersection of disciplines is inevitable. The author cites references, concepts, ideas, figures, and opinions in many fields such as philosophy, psychology, sociology, and anthropology to compare, analogize, exemplify, and criticize, and strive to put all relevant information in the design category at the right time. Show the readers, on the one hand let the readers themselves appreciate the meaning, on the other hand, carefully use their own views to guide the reader. As a result, readers have been given a rich and powerful "thought weapon" that can stand at the same height as the author and discuss the nature of design.
Third, the views are clear and powerful. For design, the author has a higher ideal and vision. While ruthlessly criticizing materialism and consumerism, the author screams at the reader with persuasive arguments and strong feelings. The ambition of design should not be limited to the superficial flashy and fancy fashion. Design can and should do more. The ultimate goal of design is to create a better world. Designers shoulder enormous responsibility.
The author's overall view makes us step on the shoulders of giants and look far ahead. The author's side blog has given us more reading clues (for example, I can't help but find the books Citizen Designer and Cradle to Cradle cited by the author, and benefit from it) and teach us Look at things with a speculative look. The author's clear perspective is not only thought-provoking, but also points us to the direction of the design field.
Whether as an experienced design expert or as an educator of evangelism, teaching, and confusing, the author gives us the most precious things through our book—wisdom and speculation.</text_trans></item>

A little bit of modification, most of them are re-released a book like the original, can't stand it, is it crazy? If you haven't bought it, you can buy it and see it. I bought it and I just lost money and bought 2 copies...</text_trans></item>

<summary>很糟糕的一本书</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>说实话，作者的确不适合作为一个作家，至少不适合成为一个传纪作家。
书的外在质量还行，也有一定的厚度。
但是内容浅薄，作者从巴菲特的小时候写起，可以说也了解巴菲特本人，但是所用的笔触大部分是旁人的经历，因为牵扯的人物太多，没有明显的线索，常常是东写一个人，西写一个人，而写关于巴菲特的事情反而显得寥寥无几。
文章无论是整体还是细节，都显得杂乱无章，缺少头绪。看的人是一头雾水。话题跳跃太大，且没有规律。
如果看官 是想本书中汲取投资技巧，投资经验、技能之类的知识，恐怕是大失所望了。里面可学的东西极少，大部分是拉家常。好像从一个遥远的地方遥望巴菲特，然而其中还隔绝着重重高山。
这些都是我的观后感，希望可以给大家有所借鉴。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Very bad book</summary_trans><text_trans>To be honest, the author is indeed not suitable as a writer, at least not suitable to be a biography writer.
The external quality of the book is ok, and it also has a certain thickness.
But the content is shallow, the author wrote from Buffett's childhood, can also say that I also understand Buffett himself, but most of the strokes used are the experience of others, because there are too many people involved, there is no obvious clue, often write a person, West Writing a person, and writing about Buffett is very few.
The article, whether it is the whole or the details, is disorganized and lacks clues. The person watching is a fog. The topic jumps too much and is not regular.
If you look at the official, you want to learn the investment skills, investment experience, skills and other knowledge in this book, I am afraid it is disappointing. There are very few things to learn, most of them are home. It seems that from a distant place to look at Buffett, but it is also isolated from the mountains.
These are my views, I hope I can give you some reference.</text_trans></item>

<text>这本书除了教会孕妈妈知识外，文字也是生动有趣的。以上的话是我之前评论的，今天看到书的后面才发现，书籍有严重的质量问题，居然缺页达到了40张，现在正在换货的过程中，看了前面朋友也有类似的情况，我觉得卓越应该反思一下，要保证质量，保持信誉。另外这几次的购物经历让我真实的感受到，书评里有很多卓越的“托”，很多书是夸大其词。</text>

This book is actually a very wrong book. It is a propaganda on the yellow belt. Where is the practitioner? If the two cities are separated, let the train stop. I thought I was watching Naruto.

<text>如题
对于保护初学者的学习兴趣，真的是功不可没
这本书没有使用华丽的技巧，只要几个基本和弦类型就能弹奏，并且效果还不错
这是对一个阶段学习的最好总结，并且让人有信心继续学下去
如果目录能按使用的和弦来分类，那将更有助于学习者，例如只用CEG就能弹的歌曲曲目，只用AmEmCm就能弹的曲目等
让学习者发现每多学1个或几个和弦就能扩大自己的可弹奏曲目范围将是件令人兴奋的事</text>

If the catalog can be sorted by the chords used, it will be more helpful to learners, such as songs that can be played only with CEG, tracks that can be played with AmEmCm, etc.
It’s exciting to let learners discover that expanding their range of playable tracks every time they learn one or more chords</text_trans></item>

<text>一直很崇拜杨老，但自从央视一期节目当中对现在的养生书籍（共10多本，其中就有这本书）进行审核时，报道这些书中无一例外的都存在着问题和错误。于是我就再也不敢看了，生怕弄错了穴位，再产生副作用，就得不偿失了。</text>

<text>书本身是经典。对于喜欢心理学和喜欢研究梦的神秘主义爱好者，这本书绝对是必读书。
我是第一次从网上买书，亚马逊发货快，可以货到付款，很不错。书比想象中厚很多。
但你确定是正版吧？收到书后它的装帧让我有点小失望。1、封面不整齐，边上突出一条折掉的部分是几个意思？2、中间有一页开了个封，在书脊处没粘好。3、结尾的第四附录怎么印了两遍？生生多出来好厚一沓。
好吧，是不是正版书也会出这种问题？
总体还可以，值得一买。希望以后注意装帧问题。</text>

<summary_trans>Is it really genuine?</summary_trans><text_trans>The book itself is a classic. For mystical lovers who like psychology and like to study dreams, this book is definitely a must read.
I bought books online for the first time. Amazon shipped quickly and can be cash on delivery, which is very good. The book is much thicker than you think.
But are you sure you are genuine? After receiving the book, its binding made me a little disappointed. 1. The cover is not neat, what is the meaning of highlighting a broken part on the side? 2. There is a page in the middle that has a seal and is not glued at the spine. 3. How did the fourth appendix at the end be printed twice? It’s so thick and thick.
Ok, is this a genuine book?
Overall, it is worth it, it is worth buying. I hope to pay attention to the binding problem later.</text_trans></item>

Three silver sacrifices, two men and one woman, imitating Spielberg's film, the criminal prophet in the minority report

Even the book has traces of imitating the big sword.
Language dialogue is extremely childish and disgusting, and it is increasingly oriented towards younger readers.

<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>看见许多人给予此书很高的评价，于是购买了此书。
顺提：
最近买的书质量都不错，发货速度也很快，希望卓越继续保持，感谢你们提供的服务。
提个建议：有些书在同类网站中搜索有，卓越无，希望能扩大经营。
对书本身的浅见：
封面上很醒目的写着“1983年原版海龟……历经24年时间考验，交易者最佳参考书”字样。
电脑时代的交易，在技术分析上拥有更大的便利，可是为什么如此多的交易者仍然失败？——人性中根深蒂固的执著没有改变。
本书的法则主要还是基于期货类的，所以在头寸计算方面的方法，对做股票的来说不大实用。
全书经得起考验的价值点，我认为主要是：
第二章：
提出典型交易情绪—希望、恐惧、贪心、绝望，以及影响交易行为的8大认知偏差，这是最最重要的基本。
这类典型情绪提供了最大的挑战，也提供了无数的机会。
第三章：
海龟培训计划的核心，以及所有成功交易的基础—掌握优势、管理风险、坚定不移、简单明了。
第四-九章：
这些章节较细的展开了思惟方式、优势、风险、简单明了的趋势工具等内涵。
剩下的几章我认为没什么了，一直到结尾，这是作者对全书的一个升华—
把交易成功的因素与失败的障碍升华到整个大的人生之中，于是“交易”便无止境。</text>

<summary_trans>Long-lasting classic</summary_trans><text_trans>I saw a lot of people giving this book a high rating, so I bought this book.
Shun:
The quality of the books I bought recently is good, the delivery speed is also very fast, I hope that excellence will continue to be maintained, thank you for your service.
A suggestion: Some books search for similar websites, there is no excellence, I hope to expand the business.
A brief view of the book itself:
The cover is strikingly written with the words "The original sea turtle in 1983... After 24 years of testing, the best reference book for traders".
Trading in the computer age has greater convenience in technical analysis, but why are so many traders still failing? - The deep-rooted obsession in human nature has not changed.
The rules of this book are mainly based on futures, so the method of position calculation is not very practical for stocks.
The value of the book that can stand the test, I think the main is:
Chapter two:
Presenting typical trading sentiments—hope, fear, greed, despair, and the eight cognitive biases that affect trading behavior—are the most important foundations.
This type of sentiment provides the greatest challenge and offers countless opportunities.
third chapter:
The core of the Turtle Training Program and the foundation of all successful transactions – mastering the strengths, managing risks, being unwavering and simple.
Chapters 4-9:
These chapters expand the connotation of thinking methods, advantages, risks, simple and clear trend tools.
The remaining chapters I think are nothing, until the end, this is a sublimation of the author to the book -
The factors that make the success of the transaction and the obstacles to failure are sublimated into the whole big life, so the "transaction" is endless.</text_trans></item>

<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>上月买的，利用办公的闲暇时间看一些看一些的也看了半本了，上来写点自己的感受分享给大家。
首先该书分为四大章的内容，在章节关系上循序渐进，在每个单元的内容表达上条理清晰，因此很方便记忆。
其次该书通过讲故事的方式来引出说话技巧的知识点，既实用又生动，文笔诙谐幽默，可以说不仅读着一点也不累，还让我已经有打算再三翻读。
再次是关于文章的内容，因为每天看一点，我可以说是现学现卖，在生活中渐渐渗入学到的知识，真的是尝到不少甜头，而且看了文中一些故事才知道原来自己以前的表现是多么差强人意，很多表达没有到位、容易产生歧义甚至还容易引起误会，明明是好意却反而引发矛盾……诸如此类。
受到这本书的点拨，开始用心去说话，说话前多思考，多注意方法之后，我看到了改变，这个真是我最大的收获，也可以说是基于这一点，很想感谢作者，所以写了上面一段话。
真心不是什么书托，我书上都做了好多笔记，是一本内容充实、有趣味性、有启发意义的好书。
至于排版纸张是一般，全书也没有什么插图，更没有任何色彩，不过我觉得最大的财富不就是文字本身么？!倒不至于有印刷问题或者装订不好的问题。</text>

<summary_trans>~~You and I deserve to have ~~</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought it last month, and I used the leisure time of the office to look at some of the things I saw. I also read some of my feelings and shared it with everyone.
First of all, the book is divided into four chapters, step by step in the chapter relationship, and the content of each unit is clearly organized, so it is easy to remember.
Secondly, the book introduces the knowledge points of speaking skills through storytelling. It is practical and vivid, and the writing is humorous. It can be said that not only is it not tired at all, but I also intend to read it again and again.
Once again, it is about the content of the article. Because I can see a little bit every day, I can say that I am learning to sell now. I gradually infiltrated the knowledge I learned in my life. I really tasted a lot of sweetness, and I read some stories in the text to know that I was The previous performance was so unsatisfactory, many expressions were not in place, ambiguous and even misleading, and it was a good intention but it caused contradictions... and so on.
I was inspired by the book and began to talk with my heart. I thought about it before I talked. After paying more attention to the method, I saw the change. This is my biggest gain. It can be said that it is based on this point. I really want to thank the author, so I wrote it. The above paragraph.
Really is not a book, I have made a lot of notes in my book, is a good book full of content, interesting and inspiring.
As for typesetting paper, it is normal. There is no illustration in the whole book, and there is no color. But I think the biggest wealth is not the text itself? It doesn't matter if there is a printing problem or a bad binding.</text_trans></item>

What's more, he puts a lot of energy into essays, not the ones that are the easiest to produce.

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>我买这本书是因为我也是Excel的热爱者，而且自认为水平还算高。本着借鉴他人思想，三人行必有我师的心理，在知道中文图书都不怎么太好的情况下，买了这本书。但是，结果是又一次失落和失望。
我给一星，理由如下：
1、这本书不适合入门者，因为这里面根本没有教你如何具体的使用Excel、如何设计表格、如何设置格式、如何布置数据、如何使用函数、如何处理和分析数据、如何使用VBA，这些统统没有。
2、这本书也不适合高手，既没有上面第一条里面的高级思想/做法，也没有Excel核心功能——数据的设计、处理和分析的详细独到见解。整本书无外乎就是告诉你用Pivot Table(数据透视表)，但是却写得非常浅薄，根本没有深入的东西。
3、作者是搞培训的，这本书看完了给人一种不好好教你，只是推销自己的感觉。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>This is a book that is neither suitable for beginners nor for novices.</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought this book because I am also a fan of Excel and I think I am still at a high level. In the mind of others, the three-person line must have the psychology of my teacher. I bought this book when I knew that Chinese books were not so good. However, the result is another loss and disappointment.
I give a star for the following reasons:
1. This book is not suitable for beginners because it does not teach you how to use Excel specifically, how to design tables, how to format, how to arrange data, how to use functions, how to process and analyze data, how to use VBA, etc. Not all.
2, this book is not suitable for masters, neither the advanced ideas / practices in the first article above, nor the core functions of Excel - detailed insights into the design, processing and analysis of data. The whole book is nothing more than telling you to use the Pivot Table, but it is very shallow and there is no deep in-depth.
3, the author is engaged in training, this book is finished to give people a kind of not good to teach you, just to sell their own feelings.</text_trans></item>

The translation of modern poetry is more sensational and unpredictable.
Although everyone can't escape the limitations of the times, the author gave a detailed introduction to the political situation in Tibet in the era of Cangyang, but there are many elements of subjective judgment.
Although I don't believe that Cangyang is a very slutty living Buddha, the image that the book passed to us is too general! The explanation of many doubts is very vague.</text_trans></item>

<summary>光盘问题解决办法</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>一：在verycd上下载光盘镜像
二：经过仔细的对比发现，有这种现象的光盘比正常光盘的要薄一些，放到光驱中不能被光驱上下夹紧。在高速旋转中打滑，转速不匀，定位不准了，导致读出错误，甚至发出马达般声响，使机器死机。那么怎么修理这种盘呢?其实很简单，只要把光盘中间光驱夹盘的位置垫厚。 为了使光驱能够夹紧光盘，用白胶布剪成小块围着中间贴成一个环(两面均可)，经过这样处理的光盘又可以正常使用了，原先不能读出的东西现在均可读出</text>

<summary_trans>CD problem solution</summary_trans><text_trans>One: download the CD image on verycd
Two: After careful comparison, it is found that the disc with this phenomenon is thinner than the normal disc, and can not be clamped up and down by the optical disc drive in the optical disc drive. Slip in high-speed rotation, the speed is not uniform, the positioning is not accurate, resulting in reading errors, and even sound like a motor, causing the machine to crash. So how to repair this disk? In fact, it is very simple, as long as the position of the disc in the middle of the disc drive is thick. In order to enable the optical drive to clamp the optical disc, it is cut into small pieces with a white tape and placed in a ring around the middle (both sides can be used). The optical disc thus processed can be used normally, and the original unreadable can now be read.</text_trans></item>

<summary>因为是草婴的译本</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>因为是草婴的译本。  如下摘自新民晚报——
“不久前，年已83岁的著名翻译家草婴因对俄罗斯文学推介的巨大贡献，被俄罗斯作家协会授予“高尔基奖章”。而1987年6月在莫斯科举行的世界文学翻译会上，草婴被授予了高尔基文学奖。草婴是唯一获此奖的中国作家。..1977年他54岁，当苦尽甘来，可以走上领导岗位，获得各种令人羡慕的待遇时，他选择了拒绝。在没有工资，没有职称的情况下，立下宏我的一生有欣慰也有遗憾。我活了八十多岁，死的感觉都已经历了两次，现在又已经完成了400万字的《托尔斯泰小说全集》的翻译工作，并由上海文艺出版社出版发行了插图版(其中的插图是由巴金珍藏的原版小说中翻拍的)。这应该说是比较欣慰的，但我也有遗憾，如在“文革”中浪费了10年时间，没能翻译更多的作品。比起那些同时代的已经去世的人，我已经获得了很多。
志，穷20年，与孤灯为伴，翻译出400万字的《托尔斯泰小说全集》。...
.除了经济利益的驱动，这还与对文学翻译事业重视程度不够有关。上世纪50年代我翻译俄文作品时，翻译稿费是11元/千字，而当时普通工人的月收入也就三十多块钱；现在翻译稿费不分文学翻译还是科技翻译，全是50元/千字。我担心如此下去，真正搞文学翻译的人会越来越少。更令人担忧的是，国人了解外面世界的窗口也会变得狭窄。文汇报：“文革”结束后，您得到了平反。当时上海准备成立译文出版社,邀请您担当总编辑一职。您为什么选择了放弃呢？
  草婴：理由只有一个——我想专心地做点事情，把托尔斯泰的全部小说翻译过来。
  1982年，女儿出国读书时兜里只揣了60美元，而飞机票还是我用刚领到的翻译稿费买的。
”——现在，你  还能想象哪一位国内一流的语言学生不去做商务，而是做文学翻译吗？而且用20年翻译？</text>

<summary_trans>Because it is a translation of the grass baby</summary_trans><text_trans>Because it is a translation of the grass baby. The following is taken from the Xinmin Evening News -
“Not long ago, the famous translator, Cao Ying, who was 83 years old, was awarded the “Gorky Medal” by the Russian Writers Association for his great contribution to the promotion of Russian literature. At the World Literature Translation Conference held in Moscow in June 1987, Grass Baby He was awarded the Gorky Literature Award. Cao Ying is the only Chinese writer to receive this award.. He was 54 years old in 1977. When he came to the leadership position and got all kinds of enviable treatment, he chose to refuse. In the absence of wages and no professional titles, Li Hong has been gratified and regretful in my life. I have lived in my 80s and have experienced two deaths. Now I have completed 4 million words of Thor. The translation of the complete works of Stein's novels, and the illustrations published by the Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House (the illustrations are remake from the original novels of Ba Jin's collection). This should be said to be quite gratifying, but I also have regrets, such as I wasted 10 years in the "Cultural Revolution" and could not translate more works. I have gained a lot more than those who have died in the same age.
Zhi, poor for 20 years, accompanied by a solitary lamp, translated the 4 million words of the complete works of Tolstoy's novels. ...
In addition to the driving of economic interests, this is also related to the lack of attention to the literary translation industry. When I translated Russian works in the 1950s, the translation fee was 11 yuan / thousand words, while the average worker's monthly income was more than 30 yuan; now the translation fee is not divided into literary translation or scientific translation, all 50 yuan. / thousand words. I am worried that this will continue, and there will be fewer and fewer people who really engage in literary translation. What is even more worrying is that the window of the Chinese people to understand the outside world will also become narrow. Wenhui Daily: After the "Cultural Revolution", you have been rehabilitated. At that time, Shanghai was preparing to set up a translation publishing house, inviting you to be the editor-in-chief. Why did you choose to give up?
  Grass Baby: There is only one reason - I want to concentrate on doing something and translate all the novels of Tolstoy.
  In 1982, when her daughter went abroad to study, she only spent $60 in her pocket, and the plane ticket was bought by the translation fee I just received.
"- Now, can you imagine which domestic first-class language students do not do business, but do literary translation? And use 20 years of translation?</text_trans></item>

1、附带“语法精要”，语法的用法说明很详细，非常适合初高中生学习，而且页面都是安排在X99（X为从1-10的数字）页，非常方便，很容易就查找到了
2、中间全页彩图部分，以彩图的形式将相近或相似或同一类的物品/词组，放在一起，方便联想记忆
3、附录部分，收录了日常交际习语，常见应用文写作指导，人民（包括含义及起源），等等，对学生来说很实用，都是上课需要学到的知识
4、词典中有大量的图画方便记忆单词
5、相近词的区别及用法也有说明
6、标注出中考词汇、高考词汇以及常用词汇，方便学生掌握单词
7、不足之处：没有双解是个遗憾，还一个就是例句略少，希望以后能增加例句，方便背单词
总之，这本词典非常的不错，非常适合正在学习的学生朋友</text>

<summary_trans>Good dictionary for students</summary_trans><text_trans>I bought it for my colleague's children. When I got it, I turned it over and summarized the following points:
1, with "grammatical essentials", the grammar usage instructions are very detailed, very suitable for junior high school students to learn, and the pages are arranged in X99 (X is a number from 1-10) page, very convenient, it is easy to find
2. In the middle of the full-page color map part, put together similar or similar items or phrases in the form of color pictures to facilitate associative memory.
3, the appendix part, including daily communication idioms, common application writing guidance, people (including meaning and origin), etc., very practical for students, are the knowledge to be learned in class
4, there are a lot of pictures in the dictionary to remember words
5, the difference between similar words and usage also have instructions
6, mark the test vocabulary, college entrance examination vocabulary and common vocabulary, to facilitate students to master the words
7. Inadequacies: It is a pity that there is no double solution. Another one is that the example sentence is slightly less. I hope I can add examples in the future to facilitate the words.
In short, this dictionary is very good, very suitable for students who are studying.</text_trans></item>

<summary>彩图粗糙、无光泽，品质如同街头巷尾的小报</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>本书很有新意：主体是反映日本民间普通人的生活；可以看作是一部日本百姓人家的衣、食、住、行，生活习俗的面面观，其观赏、学习的社会价值远远超过一般普通的风景点照片集，这本来是可以值得保留下来作为反映日本某个时期社会、民情的珍藏本；但是，无奈印刷选用的纸张品质太次，加之印刷水准低下，其结果是：彩图的印刷质量与1960年代水平差不多，图像粗糙，无光泽，与质量低劣的街头小报中的彩图差不多，完全失去了图片的艺术美感，令人大跌眼镜！
真不理解，印刷质量如此低下的书籍竟然还得到如此多的‘好评’。我的确是被这些‘好评’所诱导，选了这本赠品书。无奈，只好先留着；等印刷厂印刷质量大幅度提高后，或许再买一本。
不要忘了，此书的印刷商：北京海纳百川旭彩印务有限公司。以后凡遇到此公司印制的带有彩色图片的书籍，万万多加小心，最好先上书店实地考察考察，千万别轻易上当。以后遇到质量低下的印刷品，望大家多多相互提醒；在客观上也可以促使印刷商提高印刷质量。这叫做：有关部门不吭声，咱们读者来评议。
态度：书的内容为5星，印刷质量为0星，综合平均为1-2星，本人给2星。</text>

<summary_trans>The color picture is rough and dull, and the quality is like a tabloid in the street.</summary_trans><text_trans>This book is very new: the main body reflects the life of ordinary Japanese folks; it can be seen as a face of clothing, food, shelter, travel, and customs of a Japanese people. The social value of viewing and learning is far more than normal. A collection of ordinary scenic spots, which could have been preserved as a collection of social and public feelings reflecting a certain period in Japan; however, the quality of paper used for printing is too small, and the printing level is low. The result is: color map The print quality is similar to that of the 1960s. The image is rough and dull. It is similar to the color map in the poor quality street tabloids. It completely loses the artistic beauty of the picture and makes people stunned!
I really don't understand that books with such low print quality have received so many ‘praises’. I was indeed inspired by these ‘praises’ and chose this gift book. Helpless, had to keep it first; after the printing factory's printing quality has been greatly improved, perhaps buy another one.
Don't forget, the printer of this book: Beijing Haina Baichuan Xucai Printing Co., Ltd. In the future, if you encounter books with color pictures printed by this company, you should be careful. It is best to go to the bookstore for on-the-spot investigation and inspection. Don't be fooled. In the future, I will encounter low-quality printed materials, and I hope that everyone will remind each other; objectively, it can also encourage printers to improve printing quality. This is called: the relevant departments are not snoring, let's review them.
Attitude: The content of the book is 5 stars, the print quality is 0 stars, and the overall average is 1-2 stars. I give 2 stars.</text_trans></item>

<text>书的封面还好。打开一看，纸质非常差，看到心情都不好，侧边纸张也没有切割好，都是屑屑，摸着也好薄，很不舒服。虽然说是很便宜，但是之前在卓越买的书都是实惠的，但是质量都还过得去，这次这书让人感觉好差，里面纸质不好还黑黑的，书的侧面很不平整，好像自己拿剪刀剪的一样。失望</text>

If you read it over and over again like many people, you will be resentful of the behavior of this publisher. Ask: What are you all the Nobel Prize winners? The editors, such a high level can cut such a great work, since there is no respect, please respect the original, do not engage in a popular misleading person, misleading us to collect!

<summary>看不出是世界500强</summary>

<text>耐着性子看了大部分，作者更多是讲自己的威风史 ，特别是书中88页，作者谈到自己的离职时作为人事斗争的牺牲品，在离开后，大家都很怀念他这个阳光，奋进，创新，严格要求的人。我很少会写书评，但这次实在是忍不住了，通看全书，一点也看不到世界500强的工作影子，反而更多的是民营，国企改制的开荒牛历史，作者在书中讲到工作如何困难开展，却没有讲到解决的办法。从此书我只能看出，作者是一个很精于摸老板心思的人，可能这也是他所谓成功经历的原因吧。如果想看专业的人事方法，建议还是不要看这本书了，因为它严重偏离了人力资源从业者应该立足于扎实的人力知识，而不是玩弄权术，鼓吹自己在培训时如何潇洒，自己离职时同事多么怀念，搞不好事实往往是相反的。</text>

<summary_trans>Can't see the world's top 500</summary_trans><text_trans>Most of the authors have read the history of their own prestige, especially the 88 pages in the book. The author talks about his death as a victim of personnel struggle. After leaving, everyone misses his sunshine. People who strive for progress, innovation, and strict requirements. I rarely write a book review, but this time I can't help it. I can't see the shadow of the work of the world's top 500 at all, but more of it is private, the history of the pioneering cattle reformed by state-owned enterprises, the author is in the book. I talked about how difficult the work was to carry out, but did not talk about solutions. From this book, I can only see that the author is a person who is very good at touching the boss's mind. Perhaps this is also the reason for his so-called successful experience. If you want to see professional personnel methods, it is recommended not to read this book, because it seriously deviates from the human resources practitioners should be based on solid human knowledge, rather than playing with power, advocating how to be smart in training, when leaving How much a colleague misses, and the facts are often the opposite.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>I have an answer to the version question.</summary_trans><text_trans>I read the version of the Sanlian Bookstore. I found that the Chinese Central Committee translated the really good garbage. He is like a machine. He always wants to explain the words, but no matter how hard they try, they are the language of the machine. I have read the Sanlian very well, and it is more readable and easy to understand than the Marx's translation bureau. Moreover, in the first part of the first chapter of the first volume, I also found that the sentences in the paragraph of value and practical value are not in the translation of the Marxist Translation Bureau, or that the order of the sentences is reversed. I haven't read the original, even if I don't understand it. Specific questions you can buy two versions to compare. The words are really different. In fact, I would rather believe in a fighter who is full of revolutionary will under difficult conditions, rather than a civil servant who is nine to five.</text_trans></item>

Tell me to wait, the next time after ten days, I called the customer service and told me that I can't refund the cash. Let me go to the bank and call him before I can handle it. The attitude is tough. It is clear that it is not given back, what is the thing, and it is so strong. The first contact of this website was so disappointing.

<summary>游戏始终是游戏，还是回归现实吧</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>书的质量很好，没的说。对作者的观点我表示不认同，的确，人可以在玩游戏中寻找自信和证明自我，但是这种力量往往带不到现实中来，考试考砸了，回家被父母臭骂一顿，玩一会魔兽世界或者LOL就可以马上振作精神投入到学习中？可以马上清晰的认识到自己的不足？醒醒吧，游戏输了你可以再来，但现实就是不可以，机会错过了就是永远的错过了。这种在游戏中寻找自我的想法只会让人更加沉迷于虚拟世界，从而无法面对现实，逃避现实，多少青少年现在就是这样？游戏可以让人娱乐可以让人放松这个是无可非议的，但是，我觉得应该将重点放在如何进行劳逸结合上面，学习工作与玩游戏相结合，提高人们的学习工作效率。
总之，这本书建议不要买了，而且价格不菲，到图书馆翻一翻还是可以的，除非你想增加自己的藏书量吧！</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Is the game always a game or a return to reality?</summary_trans><text_trans>The quality of the book is very good, nothing to say. I disagree with the author's point of view. Indeed, people can look for self-confidence and self-confidence in playing games, but this kind of power often does not bring reality. The exam is tested. Go home and be stung by parents. Play one. Will World of Warcraft or LOL be able to immediately pour into the spirit of learning? Can you clearly recognize your own shortcomings immediately? Wake up, you can come back if the game loses, but the reality is not. If you miss the opportunity, you will miss it forever. This kind of thinking of finding yourself in the game will only make people more addicted to the virtual world, so that they can't face reality and escape from reality. How many teenagers are like this now? It is unobjectionable that the game can make people entertain and relax. However, I think we should focus on how to combine work and rest, study work and play games, and improve people's learning efficiency.
In short, this book is not recommended to buy, and the price is not cheap, it is ok to double the library, unless you want to increase your collection!</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Seriously does not match the facts! !</summary_trans><text_trans>Except for a good book title, the book is full of Western traditional arrogant thinking, not at all like the level of thinking of a traveler who has traveled so many countries. The book describes Xi'an to Beijing, mentioning a local landslide, and then understands that China never prompts that it can't pass, but it may not be too late. It is said that officials are not allowed to pass, but they also threaten to call the army. I estimate that it is impossible for the staff to be local officials. Secondly, it is impossible to call the army or the police. It is also said that Chinese dancing men are looking for men's jumps, women's women are looking for women's jumps, and there is a man who invites him to invite him. He is not interested in men. I read this book full of disgusting to the author! ! ! Look at my book purchase record, it is still a person who loves books. I have never been so disgusted with which book!

<summary_trans>Only start from the sit-in itself - Jiang Weiqiao "Because the child is sitting still and keeping health"</summary_trans><text_trans>This book is not recommended. If purely sitting quietly, I recommend Jiang Weiqiao’s "Because the child is sitting in the health regime" (China Changan Publishing House), which is excellent. What is special is that it only starts from the sit-in itself, and does not involve the Buddhist Zen. It can avoid the prejudice of the students who have stereotypes in the field of consciousness. And pay attention to objectivity, do not exaggerate its mystery, so that the practice of sit-in can be widely accepted. Teacher Jiang’s observation method is very useful.</text_trans></item>

<text>著作者按道理应该是国内一流的学者了，看到“中央美术学院人文学院美术史系列国外美术史教研室”的大名就买下来，花了四五天的时间通读了一遍，内容让我有些失望。与阿纳森的《西方现代艺术史:绘画•雕塑•建筑》相比较真的水平非常平庸。通篇就是一种人名及内容的罗列，对于作品和人物的分析太过简单，比如常常出现这样的评论“某某某画家，代表性的作品是某某某，作品高多少多少。”我认为这样的美术评论太过草率。总之，本书作为普及型读物读起来索然无味，而作为专业书籍又缺乏深度，真不知道这样的书定位到底在那个位置。
总结一下，本书对于无论是专业知识的扫盲或者专业领域的研究都没有多少价值。当然作为某些学校考试用书就另当别论了，可能这就是本书唯一的价值了吧。</text>

<summary_trans>average level</summary_trans><text_trans>The authors should be the first-class scholars in the country. I saw the name of the "Art History Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in the Department of Art History" and bought it. It took four or five days to read through it. The content made me a little disappointed. . Compared with Arnson's "Western Modern Art History: Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture", the level of truth is very mediocre. The whole article is a list of names and contents. The analysis of works and characters is too simple. For example, there is often such a comment. "A certain painter, a representative work is a certain, how much higher the work." I think Such art reviews are too sloppy. In short, this book is uninteresting as a popular reading, and as a professional book, there is no depth. I really don't know if such a book is positioned in that position.
To sum up, this book has little value for literacy in professional knowledge or in research in the professional field. Of course, as some school exam books, it is another matter. Maybe this is the only value of this book.</text_trans></item>

<summary>大师视野下的艺术史！</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这本书的内容非常好啊！的确是全球风行的艺术史之一啊。
　　要是我没有把书捧在手上读之前，我是的确觉得这本书贵的。事实上，之所以冒险买下来了，原因有：
  1、全世界公认的好版本一定有它的道理；
  2、是行家的用心翻译：20年、10年之前分别出版过不同的2版，第一次491页，第二次688页，翻译者至少用心翻译过2次。现在再时隔10年重新出版，最起码也可以做些很好的微小印刷翻译订正；
  3、有限的几个购买者对内容的网上评论是一致的：好书！
　　
　　有人说到原书有法文版的更加便宜些，可怜见我连个法文字母也认识不全，当然只有买国内的翻译版了。但说实话，在还没有上手看过前，买这本如此贵的书还真是有点冒险，但肯定不是价格原因：首先，看内容，1999年三联版和现在的一样；不同的是，以前是定价228元/精装，现在是280元/平装——去掉精、平之比较，简单的价格比是280/228=122.8%，绝对增长了22.8%，10年时间，按照年复利增长率1.9%计算的。其次，孔夫子网站曾经有人N年前一直挂价求购新16版三联版而不得。当然，更加直观的是简单地看印张价格：43个印张的价格，卓越给出网购190.4元——4.43元/印张（含彩印），大家可以和自己手头同期引进艺术类书籍比较一下就知道了。所以可以简单得出的结论是：光是简单地看印张价格，至少没有吃很大的亏啊。
  但买书不是只看印张价格的，关键是内容!
　　
　　要说最冒险的是，书籍没有上手翻阅过、没有看到过关于书籍内容的评论，好书之人一般是不甘心花这个价格买的，担心万一买砸了是要懊悔好几年的，虽然也就是1件新冬衣的价格，那种心疼和新衣可以储藏N年的时间是差不多的。
　　
　　当初有人推荐说这是本好书，我是半信半疑的：没有在线试读、没有看到过纸质试读本、没有网络视频，之前没有买过这家中小出版社的书籍。大家都知道出版有很多环节的，不仅仅是与作者、译者、编辑有关。最后确定冒险一把的一个重要因素是：不想买黑白的旧版本——看艺术类书，图片不能相差甚远，文字页码也不能少了近30%（对不起，我买书好象还真没有认真关心过版权是高价还是低价来的，只是就内容论书籍，所谓内容为王）。
　　
　　开头翻看序言，只几页就吸引得放不下手了，作者的功力到底是世界顶尖大师级别的啊，视觉独到新颖开阔，用辞简洁明快。翻译也有信达雅的意境，很不错。倒底是20年前范先生就翻译过的（黑白旧版），新16版在1999年又翻译一遍由三联出版，现在再过了10年总算又有了，估计需要翻译订正、印刷修订的部分应该更完善了。
　　
　　只是，书虽然说是16开，却不是标准16开《读者》杂志大小的那种，是比普通书籍大一圈的开本。具体尺寸可见评论童靴们的描述。
　　具体内容我认为真不错，可是说一千道一万，还是要看自己喜好的。可惜偶没有扫描机，没办法帮助爱书者们做些电子版的在线观看。
　　另外，这本书是平装的，当时候想，有没有搞错，这么贵的书怎么还会是平装？！要是精装的当然更有利于实用兼收藏，不过线锁的平装也有利于实际翻阅！话说我最近的行程上一直带上它，可以反复看啊。对于卓越打折后书价依然高昂的疑虑，在书上手翻阅后就烟消云散：那么多的、密实的一流原创内容，对应耳目一新的述史新体例，怎么好意思再多有抱怨呢？
　　
　　关键：厚实的16版本，文字功力十足力透纸背的688页！完全按照外方标准制作的排版与彩印，超值了！　　
　　
　　 我现在不以为这书会很快重印，因为首印尽管数量不大（这个对出版社很不利的），但卓越一直有货，估计会卖上好几个月或更长一段时间，这个要看折扣程度来确定的。到底是小众书籍嘛。对中小出版社而言，投入不小，所以现在的经济情形很难判断出版社会很快重印。
　　
　　有时候首印数量不大的书，价格再贵一点也不是没有可能的。好在这是个不大的出版社，第一需要是在当前金融危机下降低资金积压风险，好在这次网站售书大打折扣，有机会就抢进一本。更令人诧异的是，这书竟然一下子在网站热销起来，常常在同类销售中排名前列。看来喜欢这本书的童靴们还是不少，都是以前被缺货、高价、想要好版本给憋得慌的。这般折扣持续销售下去，私下以为在接下去的1年内，这批次印的书会销售一空；但如果再加印1倍，短期市场容量就不一定能够消化。那时候就不知道下次这个已经买下版权的中小出版社是否还有在金融危机面前敢一掷千金做长销书的魄力、以及什么时候才肯再印了？
　　
　　话外的最后一个疑问是，下次推出的是否还是平装？亦或是精装珍藏版了？</text>

<summary>对作者对软件测试工程师和测试行业的认识不敢苟同</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>我最近购买了《编程之美》这本书，真是希望了解微软的高手们对编程的理解。但是当阅读到本书的VI 面试杂谈时，有一段话，我深感意外，
“那些只会用鼠标点击测试，然后报告bug的人员叫Software Test Engineer（STE），这样的事一般会外包给别的公司。“，我对作者及编辑对
软件测试工程师工作的理解不敢苟同，测试工程师的工作也有非常多的技术含量的，其工作也不仅仅是点击鼠标进行测试，微软可能是这样，据我了
解微软有测试驱动开发和测试工程师两种岗位，测试工程师是按照测试驱动开发工程师开发完成的测试工具去做测试的，但是国内或国外，基本上
还不是这样做测试，不像微软去招聘一位家庭主妇去做Windows或Office的点击测试，测试工程师是需要大量的测试设计、测试分析的。
  该书的作者都是微软的员工，书的舆论导向对测试行业的发展无意，对测试工程师工作的误解，对测试外包公司也是一种蔑视，作为向国内大众
发行的书，这种描述是对测试行业认知上的偏激和错误理解，希望你们做出妥善处理，消除对测试工程师及测试外包公司的误解和蔑视，做益于软件
行业发展的事情，做促进软件质量发展的事情。测试工程师和开发工程师一样，都是为了公司推出高质量的产品，工作没有贵贱之分，你微软认为把
技术含量低的工作外包给公司是公司行为，并不具有代表性，无论如何不能伤害国内正在发展之中的软件测试行业及广大测试工程师。

<summary_trans>I don’t agree with the author’s knowledge of software test engineers and the testing industry.</summary_trans><text_trans>I recently purchased the book "The Beauty of Programming". I really want to know the understanding of programming by Microsoft's masters. But when I read the VI interview interview in this book, I was surprised by a paragraph.
"Those who only use the mouse to click on the test and then report the bug are called Software Test Engineer (STE), which is usually outsourced to other companies.", I am the author and editor.
The understanding of the software test engineer's work is not the same. The test engineer's work also has a lot of technical content. The work is not just a click of the mouse for testing. Microsoft may be like this, according to me.
Microsoft has test-driven development and test engineers in two positions. Test engineers are tested according to test tools developed by test-driven development engineers, but domestic or foreign, basically
This is not the test, unlike Microsoft to hire a housewife to do Windows or Office click testing, test engineers need a lot of test design, test analysis.
  The authors of the book are all employees of Microsoft. The public opinion orientation of the book is not intended for the development of the testing industry. The misunderstanding of the work of test engineers is also a contempt for test outsourcing companies.
The issued book, this description is a partial and misunderstanding of the test industry. I hope that you can properly handle it, eliminate misunderstandings and contempt for test engineers and test outsourcing companies, and benefit from software.
Things that are developing in the industry, doing things that promote the development of software quality. Test engineers, like development engineers, are all selling high-quality products for the company. There is no expensive work. You think Microsoft
Outsourcing of low-tech jobs to companies is a corporate behavior and is not representative. In any case, it cannot harm the software testing industry and the majority of test engineers in China.

<text>如果说老师是灵魂的工程师，那无疑书本就是工程师手中的工具。想把一个孩子从平地堆入云端，除了有好的工程师外，优秀的工具也是必不可少的。
我是一个大学生，但我依然会像孩子一样去看这些大人眼中幼稚的图画书。有时候我不得不承认，中国的儿童图书真的太落后了，当我拿到这套儿童情绪管理书的时候，我就在思考，为什么国外有这样的作者，他们是那么的理解一个孩子需要阅读的是什么，而不是像我们的某些作家，为的只是自己的出名，自己的利益。
不得不承认，他们走在儿童图书的前沿，不过庆幸的是我们有人能引进这些书，能让我们的孩子也看到这些真正写给他们的书。有读者说书过于精美，书的内容太少，我有点无法理解，一套为学龄前孩子准备的书，我们有理由不把最美好的世界呈现给他们吗？我们有理由在他们还在认识世界的时候就把我们的思想用文字强加给他们吗？说句实话，我更希望孩子在他能真正的理解这个世界之前，看到的所有书籍都是图画，没有一个我们添加上去的字，没有一个！有的只是一幅幅精美异常的图画，让他们自己去看，自己去想。只有这样，孩子的思想才不会被束缚，孩子以后才能成长的更加健康。</text>

Want to put a child from the ground into the cloud, in addition to good engineers, excellent tools are also essential.
I am a college student, but I will still look at the childish picture books in the eyes of these adults like children. Sometimes I have to admit that Chinese children's books are really too backward. When I got this set of children's emotional management books, I was thinking about why there are such authors abroad. They understand the needs of a child. What is read, not some of our writers, is just their own fame and their own interests.
I have to admit that they are at the forefront of children's books, but fortunately we can introduce these books so that our children can see the books that are actually written for them. Some readers say that the book is too beautiful, the content of the book is too small, I am a little incomprehensible, a set of books for preschool children, we have reason not to present the best world to them? Do we have reason to impose our thoughts on them when they are still knowing the world? To be honest, I hope that all the books that the child sees before he can truly understand the world are pictures, there is no word we add, no one! Some are just a beautiful and unusual picture, let them go and see for themselves. Only in this way, the child's thoughts will not be bound, and the child will grow healthier in the future.</text_trans></item>

<text>读完之后，有两个地方不能满足个人阅读需求：说了太多的“废话”，以及太多的引用（其实，完全可以用一半的篇幅简洁地表达），另外，整本书还停留在粗线条和大框架地介绍华为和任正非，缺少细节刻画和内部深入（或许是华为向来的低调造成的束缚？）所以在这点上，给三星，考虑到此书是目前少有的比较有权威又能比较全面介绍华为和任正非的书籍，就给四星了。
　　
　　就华为和任正非来说，给我很大的鼓舞，中华民族苦苦地追求复兴，可那让人欲说还休的民族劣根性和外部大环境，有时让人绝望，但一个带有理想主义色彩，并富有家国情怀的人，以独特而又传奇的方式，证明了中华可以有为。能做到这一点，光靠聪明才智是不行的（中国向来不缺少这样的人，甚至聪明过头的人），更重要的是如同陈春花教授在序言中提到的，任正非的所做所为体现了“心灵的力量”。可以矫情地说，任正非及华为，很励志。
　　
　　通过阅读此书，让我更进一步认识到，成功没有什么捷径，那是实实在在地付出自己的青春和心血来铸就，而在平时，媒体为了宣传和阅读的效果，往往对那些成功的企业和企业家，“用虚拟的方法塑造一个虚化的人”（任正非语）。而任正非及华为的成功，作者分析了很多，个人认为“自我批判”这点很重要，民族的复兴也需要这一点，不然改良与改革都无从谈起。当意识到这一点时，对我来说，鲁迅的价值以及饱受争议的“鲁迅与胡适之争”也就尘埃落定了。</text>

<summary_trans>I used to be inspirational and take positive energy.</summary_trans><text_trans>After reading, there are two places that can't satisfy the individual's reading needs: too much "nonsense" and too many references (in fact, it can be expressed in half by succinct), in addition, the whole book still stays in Introducing Huawei and Ren Zhengfei in thick lines and large frames, lacking detailed characterization and internal deepening (maybe the shackles caused by Huawei's low-key?) So at this point, to Samsung, considering that this book is rare and authoritative. A comprehensive introduction to Huawei and Ren Zhengfei's books will give four stars.

As far as Huawei and Ren Zhengfei are concerned, I am greatly encouraged. The Chinese nation is struggling to pursue rejuvenation. But the ethnic inferiority and external environment that make people want to talk about it are sometimes desperate, but one with idealism. The people who are full of family feelings prove that China can do something in a unique and legendary way. To be able to do this, it is impossible to rely on wisdom and intelligence (China has always lacked such people, even those who are too clever), and more importantly, as what Professor Chen Chunhua mentioned in the preface, Ren Zhengfei’s actions are reflected. "The power of the mind." It can be said that Ren Zhengfei and Huawei are very inspirational.

By reading this book, I have further realized that there is no shortcut to success, that is, to really pay for your youth and hard work to create, and in normal times, the media for the purpose of propaganda and reading, often for those successful enterprises And entrepreneurs, "to create a virtual person with a virtual method" (Ren Zhengfei). The success of Ren Zhengfei and Huawei, the author analyzed a lot, personally think that "self-criticism" is very important, the national rejuvenation also needs this, otherwise there is no way to improve and reform. When I realized this, for me, the value of Lu Xun and the controversial "the dispute between Lu Xun and Hu Shi" were settled.</text_trans></item>

<summary>很好呀</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>我觉得书很不错，纸的质量也好，包装也好，总让人有爱不释手的感觉。我周日订的货，周二就到了，非常快，而且送货员的态度也很好，说若质量不好可以在网上随时退换货，他本人就常在卓越网上购物。不过我爸爸验货时没注意到，其中第七本（与死圣）有一页中间撕了，而且有折页，但是如果换货要整套的换，我嫌麻烦就用胶带粘了粘（也不影响阅读）。提醒：验货时要仔细。
这套书价格是挺贵的（不过我不后悔买了它），因为他有珍藏价值，质量确实好，所以一狠心就买下了。所以如果你真的很喜欢哈利波特，而且又具备一定的英语水平，还是建议买这套原版的。如果只图看看内容的话，那也没必要花这么多钱，图书馆、上网、买中文版的都能解决，是吧？</text>

<summary_trans>that's great</summary_trans><text_trans>I think the book is very good, the quality of the paper is good, the packaging is good, and there is always a feeling of love. The goods I ordered on Sunday, arrived on Tuesday, very fast, and the attitude of the deliveryman is also very good, saying that if the quality is not good, you can return the goods at any time on the Internet, he himself often shop online. However, my father did not notice when he inspected the goods. The seventh one (with the death sacred) had a page torn in the middle, and there were folds, but if the replacement was to be replaced, I would use tape to stick it. Does not affect reading). Reminder: Be careful when inspecting the goods.
The price of this book is quite expensive (but I don't regret buying it), because he has a collection value, the quality is really good, so I bought it at a glance. So if you really like Harry Potter and have a certain level of English, it is still recommended to buy this original version. If you only look at the content, then there is no need to spend so much money, the library, the Internet, and the Chinese version can be solved, right?</text_trans></item>

After reading "One Hundred Years of Solitude", "Love in Cholera", "I am not coming to the lecture", I always feel that the story written by Ma is smooth and gives people a lot of imagination.

In the middle of the night, someone called him and asked him to come before Nola Dejakov’s death. Go and pull her." Doesn't this Nora appear at the beginning of this chapter?

It’s different, I still think that the “good mother doesn’t want to call the education boy 100 strokes”, it is more suitable for parents with boys to see, the content is simple and clear, even if there is no time, you can also see a trick, and this book The child is a girl. The boy's mental growth is much different from that of a girl. I feel that I am not a man's psychology to a boy. I don't know how to grow up. I don't know how to teach. "Good mother doesn't want to teach a boy 100 strokes." Not only talk about the boy's psychological and physical growth, but also let us pull in the distance between the mother and the child, teach well, and recommend that the parents of the boy buy this book...</text_trans></item>

按照现在的说法就是有点小资情调， 早一些的说法就是卖弄。 没有什么深层次的东西值得花时间。 也看不出其人有什么独立的观点。 不读也罢！

Recorded is a woman in her 30s, a general experience. People like her in the investment bank don't dare to say that they are full of enthusiasm. It’s just a labor-intensive worker. Maybe she has a different story at Phoenix Satellite TV (I don’t think she is a good host).
According to the current statement, it is a bit of a petty bourgeoisie. The earlier saying is to show off. Nothing deep is worth the time. I also don't see any independent views of people. Don't read it!

<text>买书是为了看内容，而不是看作者的名气。启功先生的书法我也特别的喜欢，但是对于他老先生的这本书我实在不敢恭维。因为本书是讲我们在学习书法的过程中应该摒弃迷信，而非真正的给你讲如何写书法。如果说本书还有什么可取之处的话，我认为本书最大的价值还在于书中选取的书法作品和图片。
  本书的原名是《破除迷信——和学习书法的青年朋友谈心》，《启功给你讲书法》是这次改版时出版社改的名字，这样改只不过是想借启功先生的名气多买几本书，多赚钱。而实际上这样的修改不仅是对购买者的不负责任，也是对作者的不负责任，我想启功如果活到现在，他也一定不会同意改成现在的这个名字的。</text>

<summary_trans>Please note!</summary_trans><text_trans>Buying books is to look at the content, not the author's reputation. I also liked the calligraphy of Mr. Qi Gong, but I can't compliment his old gentleman's book. Because this book is about saying that we should abandon superstition in the process of learning calligraphy, rather than telling you how to write calligraphy. If there is anything to be said about the book, I think the greatest value of this book lies in the calligraphy works and pictures selected in the book.
  The original name of the book is "Breaking Superstition - Talking to Young Friends Learning Calligraphy", "Qi Gong tells you about calligraphy" is the name changed by the publishing house during this revision. This change is just to borrow the name of Mr. Qi Gong. Buy a few more books and make more money. In fact, such a modification is not only irresponsible to the purchaser, but also irresponsible to the author. I think that if he lives to this day, he will not agree to change to the current name.</text_trans></item>

<summary>爱恨悠悠</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>《长恨歌》是多年前看过的小说，当时正在外地出差，无数了疲于工作又思念家人的夜晚，就是在一点一点啃噬这本书中度过的。
书看过大约一年，郑秀文主演的影视版面世了。
旧上海我本不熟悉，王安忆在书中大段大段的气氛渲染和景致刻画，让我读的时候即迷恋那些笔调慵懒的文字，又急于在这一片铺陈之中找出我说需要的线索，说真的，有些部分很是晦涩，需要不断反复的重看去回味，才逐渐的体会个中滋味。
从这个角度出发，我很感激影视版的出现，它把理解的过程留给了导演和演员们，给我们的只是欣赏，再欣赏。
借这个机会对影视版做一个简单的评价：影视版中我印象最深刻的是郑秀文和胡军，大概因为他们比较出名的关系，一下子就记忆深刻起来。郑秀文的扮相与演技我很认可，“沪上淑媛”王琦瑶因她的润色鲜活的呈现在我的面前——把那可人藏在心里，把那矜持放在脸上，很是生动。胡军饰演的将军其实只是王琦瑶生命中匆匆过客，算不得主角，可明星情结的我很是有点不解，这样仪表堂堂又MAN又多金的将军，王琦瑶不像被包养的小蜜，倒像是走了桃花运了，呵呵。角色的选取和书中王琦瑶从还是不从的心理纠结有点搭不上。说是这么说，有了胡军的参演，我都爱看了许多。
书中的线索，均围绕着上海小姐王琦瑶的情与爱，她的旧上海弄堂，她的小姐妹，她的二奶生活，她的追求者，她的围炉夜话。。。。。那些琐碎细小的典型上海小资女人的生活，恍如王琦瑶一段段午后的呓语，又如她的那些沉淀的梦境，浮光掠影，在我们面前缓慢的铺陈着，和着茶炉的水气渗到我们的眼里心里。
这样一个爱恨悠悠的故事，最适合在午后洒满微尘的阳光下徜徉着，缀着奶茶，缓缓读来。相信读罢，心底必有一声叹息微漾。。。</text>

<summary_trans>Love and hate</summary_trans><text_trans>"The Song of Everlasting Sorrow" is a novel that I saw many years ago. I was on a business trip abroad. I had countless nights when I was tired of working and missing my family. I spent the little bit of this book.
The book has been seen for about a year, and the film version starring Sam Xiu-wen has appeared.
I am not familiar with the old Shanghai. Wang Anyi’s large-scale atmosphere and landscape depiction in the book made me obsessed with the lazy words when I read, and I was anxious to find out what I said in this piece. The clues, really, some of them are very embarrassing, and they need to be repeated and revisited to relive the taste, and gradually realize the taste.
From this perspective, I am very grateful for the emergence of the film and television version. It left the process of understanding to the directors and actors, and only gave us appreciation and appreciation.
I would like to take this opportunity to make a simple evaluation of the film and television version: I am most impressed by the film and television version of Zheng Xiuwen and Hu Jun, probably because of their relatively famous relationship, they suddenly remembered. Zheng Xiuwen's appearance and acting skills I admit, "Shanghai Shangyuan" Wang Qiyao is presented in front of me because of her touch-up - hiding the person in my heart, putting that hold on the face, very vivid. The general played by Hu Jun is actually only a hurried passer in Wang Qiyao’s life. It’s not a protagonist. I’m a bit puzzled by the star complex. This is a general and a man with a lot of money, and Wang Qiyao is not like a small honey that is being fostered. It’s gone, I’m lucky, huh, huh. The selection of the character and the psychological entanglement of Wang Qiyao in the book are still not enough. That is to say, with the participation of Hu Jun, I have loved watching a lot.
The clues in the book revolve around the love and love of Miss Shanghai Wang Qiyao, her old Shanghai alley, her little sister, her mistress life, her pursuer, her furnace night talk. . . . . The life of those trivial and small typical Shanghai petty bourgeois women, such as Wang Qiyao’s slang in the afternoon, and her dreams of precipitation, floating in the air, slowly paving in front of us, and the water of the tea stove infiltrated our eyes. In my heart.
Such a story of love and hate is best suited to squat in the afternoon sun lit with dust, adorned with milk tea, and slowly read. I believe that after reading, there will be a sigh in my heart. . .</text_trans></item>

<summary>有关创意的方方面面</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>最近不少书都是根据国外知名大学的课程整理出来的，应该说都具备相当的水平。本书则重点讲的是“有关创意的方方面面”，比如背景、环境、团队、模型等，对我一定启发。
这里提到的模型是由6个因素组成相互联系的环，包括知识（Knowledge）、想象力(imagination)、态度(attitude)、资源(resources)、环境(habitat)、文化(culture)书里有几节目讲的是这几部分的内容和关系（至少在我看来本书是严格按这六个方面写的，作者好像也没这个意思）
书里还有几个点有些启发。
有时压力越大思维越活跃，应该就是所谓的“没困难要上，有困难解决困难也要上”后半句的意思。书里举的例子是911之后易趣做的一个捐款网站，本来计划三个月完成，结果3天搞定，第一天设计、第二天编码、第三天测试，然后就可以正式使用了——没有压力怕是不会有这个进度。
有时约束也能催生创意。围脖就让写140个字，就由此产生了不少不错的创意。其实中国的六言或者八言绝句也是一种限制，期间的变化繁多，相信大家都有所了解。
书里还讲到了游戏的几个原则。我印象最深就是“及时反馈”这条。很多工作本来大家做得有兴趣，但是因为领导或者其它方面没有给予有力和及时的反馈，慢慢的大家的兴趣也就减少了，接着工作不了了之。也许管理者应该向游戏多多学习些东西。
最后就是团队在创新中也会起到非常重要的作用。一来很多事是大家集体想出来的（书里想了一些头脑风爆法的应用），其二是大家都有力量可以在合适的条件下贡献出来。书里举了一个团队经过认真准备和分析登上珠穆朗玛的故事。本来只应安排一人登顶的。
本书是本有关创新各方面介绍的书，如果工作中常用到创意，建议有空就看下。</text>

<summary_trans>All aspects of creativity</summary_trans><text_trans>Recently, many books have been compiled according to the courses of well-known foreign universities, and they should all be said to have a considerable level. This book focuses on "all aspects of creativity," such as background, environment, team, model, etc., which will inspire me.
The model mentioned here is composed of six factors that are interconnected, including knowledge, imagination, attitude, resources, habitat, culture, and culture. Several programs are about the content and relationship of these parts (at least in my opinion, the book is written strictly according to these six aspects, the author does not seem to mean this)
There are a few more inspirations in the book.
Sometimes the greater the pressure, the more active the thinking, it should be the so-called "no difficulty to go up, there are difficulties to solve difficulties." The example in the book is a donation website made by eBay after 9/11. It was planned to be completed in three months. The result will be fixed in 3 days, the first day design, the second day code, and the third day test, and then it can be officially used. There is no pressure to fear that there will be no such progress.
Sometimes constraints can also lead to creativity. The bib has 140 words written, which has produced quite a lot of good ideas. In fact, China's six-character or eight-character quatrains are also a kind of restriction. During the period, there are many changes. I believe everyone knows everything.
The book also talks about several principles of the game. My deepest impression is the "timely feedback". A lot of work was originally done by everyone, but because the leadership or other aspects did not give strong and timely feedback, the interest of everyone slowly decreased, and then work could not be done. Maybe managers should learn a lot from the game.
Finally, the team will play a very important role in innovation. A lot of things have come up collectively (the book thinks about the application of some brainstorming methods), and the other is that everyone has the power to contribute under the right conditions. The book gives a story of a team carefully prepared and analyzed on Mount Everest. Originally, only one person should be placed at the top.
This book is a book about all aspects of innovation. If you use creativity in your work, it is recommended to look at it when you have time.</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>Pirate book</summary_trans><text_trans>This is an uncompromising pirated book, which is a piece of the contents of Carnegie's various books. The paper is not good, the printing is very unclear and there are typos. Today's pirated books are also very fine. Now It is also a good luck to buy such a rough pirated book. If you want to buy it, you should first understand that you should not blindly choose a book like me. The more I look at it, the more I am wrong, because a lot of the content is mentioned in the book Carnegie Communication and Interpersonal Relationships I bought. This is the genuine, so-called selection, the collector's edition is fake. Don't be fooled.</text_trans></item>

<summary>故事不错，中国制造，但是作者实在脱离生活</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>故事原创，在中国已经不错了，
但是作者实在太脱离生活现实了，越写越离谱，（我不是说情节，而是一些场景、镜头）
比如第四部中，几个族群打得正欢，壹索说了几句话就停战了，可能吗？？？？
太假了吧！！！很明显作者一点点基础的政治斗争经验都没有，甚至可以说很幼稚。
但五六年级的小孩在还看不到这个缺点，因为作者的生活经验和他们相当，反而会更喜欢，但最终会误导了小孩子们，让他们觉得生活社会和战争很简单，不好不好！！！！</text>

<summary_trans>The story is good, made in China, but the author is really out of life</summary_trans><text_trans>The original story is good in China.
But the author is too far from the reality of life, the more written the more outrageous, (I am not talking about the plot, but some scenes, shots)
For example, in the fourth part, several ethnic groups played well, and after a few words, they stopped fighting, is it possible? ? ? ?
It’s too fake! ! ! It is obvious that the author has little or no basic political struggle experience, and can even be said to be very naive.
But the children of the fifth and sixth grades still can't see this shortcoming. Because the author's life experience is quite similar to them, they will prefer it, but they will eventually mislead the children and make them feel that life society and war are very simple. ! ! ! !</text_trans></item>

<summary>强烈推荐</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>很喜欢，强烈推荐！还准备再读一遍。
初看书的目录，貌似和其他励志类书籍没什么大的区别。一共30个法则。目录则列出30个所谓的法则。
但是一章一章的看下去，这些老套的成功学理论又被作者重新梳理、诠释一番。我觉得就是角度更正面，更积极。经过作者的解释，你内心会更乐意/容易接受这些个法则，并且愿意/相信它们会改变的你的生活，并且帮助你幸福。
可能这些是我刚看完的主观印象，也可能下次看会发现其中更多的漏洞。但是总之，这是我看完第一遍的真实感受，它帮助我解决了一些人生的困惑。
比如书里告诉你，你为什么要一直努力，一直奋斗，为什么不坐享其成，知足常乐？</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>highly recommended</summary_trans><text_trans>I like it very much, highly recommended! Also ready to read it again.
The catalogue of the first reading book seems to be no different from other inspirational books. A total of 30 rules. The catalog lists 30 so-called rules.
However, after reading the chapters and chapters, these old-fashioned theories of successful learning have been reorganized and interpreted by the authors. I think the angle is more positive and more positive. After the author's explanation, you will be more willing / easy to accept these rules, and willing / believing that they will change your life and help you to be happy.
Maybe these are the subjective impressions I just read, and maybe I will find more of them in the next time. But in short, this is the real feeling of my first reading, it helped me solve some of the confusion in life.
For example, the book tells you why you have to work hard and struggle all the time. Why not sit down and enjoy yourself?</text_trans></item>

<summary>just what you want</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>拿到手上后，每个读者应该或多或少有一种这样的经历，这本书，属于我，就是我，只有我。首先，由于自身专业的基础，这本书上学术理论的要点能很顺畅的给我在原有的有限知识库里提炼出更精密的论点。其次，细观之后，它也能在一定程度上给我高度归纳和总结出一些边缘科学的思考。我觉得吧，既然西医是国外的精髓，类似于学术理论与实践相结合的书刊，就应该以积极向上的心态，去学习感悟别国的科学领域。同时也期望，不久的将来，自己有能力去品读专业真正的原版书籍。毕竟翻译后的中文，有很大程度上的局限性。而原版，更能表达出作者的更宽广学科深度与探索。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Just what you want</summary_trans><text_trans>After getting the hand, each reader should have more or less such an experience. This book belongs to me, that is me, only me. First of all, due to the foundation of my own profession, the main points of academic theory in this book can smoothly extract more precise arguments from the original limited knowledge base. Secondly, after careful observation, it can also give me a high degree of generalization and summarization of some marginal science thinking to a certain extent. I think that since Western medicine is the essence of foreign countries, similar to the combination of academic theory and practice, we should learn to understand the scientific field of other countries with a positive attitude. At the same time, I also hope that in the near future, I will be able to read the real original books of the profession. After all, translated Chinese has a lot of limitations. The original version is more able to express the author's broader discipline depth and exploration.</text_trans></item>

<summary>走出一小步，再一小步</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>首先谢谢张老师与马丁纳老师这份新年礼物，60个问题，60篇对话和回答，这比一个人著书好，有交流感，读的时候，仿佛有两位老师在场，一左一右——如封皮上印的一样——陪伴我们走过心灵的漫漫长谈。
  心灵的漫漫长谈……这说法，其实也有点问题。
  人在困惑的时候，遇见良师，遇见益友，陪你聊天，给你启发，这是幸福的。然而，人生终究不是一场漫漫长谈，而是一条漫漫长路，若无行动，永远只能停在原地，哪怕天天谈，月月谈，年年谈。
  这是此刻，我的感受，启发自书中，也源于生活。
  得知德芬老师在豆瓣上的赠书活动我是这样写信过去的：“我和前男友分手多年，但仍放不下心里的迷惑和悔恨，对未来提不起精神来。如果你们认为这本书对我有帮助，请寄给我；如果没有，就请寄给需要的人。”
  这么写，也是因为看了很多书，往往只激动一时，却从未在实际生活中见效，上面的问题，仍在。
  书仍被寄来了，我知道，只有邮件那头的人怀着永不放弃的热心，才会这样做，好像一个亲切的朋友，说：“你再试试，你再试试吧！”
  然而，也是这本书——同样亲切的朋友——告诉我：你要靠自己，你要用自己的行动。是的，从思想到心的距离，是世界上最远的距离。
  从心到行动，也是。
  我不知道这是不是因为懒，还是因为没有信心，不管是什么，现在总归到了我克服它们的时刻。
  60段对话，读读停停，新的想法总是在字里行间和间歇的时候蹦出来。我渐渐悟出使我现在那么痛苦的原因。不全是因为男朋友的分手、离去、他过去做的事对我的伤害，还因为我自己对自己的不负责任与不成熟。在分手后的岁月里，我没有看到这一点，没有把注意力放在自己身上，没有去提高自己，而是把注意力全部放在了指责、埋怨对方上。
  对，他是有错。但那又怎么样呢？他有错就是你不能幸福的理由吗？！这是你的人生。你的人生，不能由他和他的错误决定。
  “我的事，他人的事，老天的事”。我痛苦的原因——他的错，我的对我的人生不负责任——如果各占50%的话，我只能做好我的事，对我的人生负责，把没做好的做好。
  至今，我还不知原谅是什么感觉的。我一直想原谅他，可做不到。也许，现在还不是能知道原谅滋味的时候，也许，等我把我那50%做好了的时候吧。</text>

<summary>标题党：文不对题</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>《淡定的人生不寂寞》，在亚马逊推荐书单中看见这本。标题中三个词吸引我：淡定、人生、寂寞。淡定是我一直追求而未得的心态，人生是我一直思考而不得答案的问题，寂寞，一抹唯美，一抹淡雅。这本书在我的亚马逊收藏夹里放了很久，前几天买书时顺便买了。
书到手，翻开，读序，《淡是人生最深的滋味》。爱情、婚姻、世事、人生。淡，也是一种味道。据说小孩子比较喜欢甜甜的、味道重的食物。青年喜欢刺激的。而随着年纪增长，心慢慢淡下来，才有心情去体会平淡，品味平淡中的味道。
第一篇，《人淡如菊》，读完惊愕，有一种心事被人说穿的感觉，感觉就是自己心底里想说而未说的话，由别人说出来了，而且说的是那样准确。或者是，自己心底的想法，朦胧的、不明确的，无法表达清楚，而别人的语言，刚好表达了这种想法。
第一篇文章吸引了我，继续读下去，却是越来越失望。整本书由爱情故事构成，一共100篇（貌似），或者其中间杂着不超过5篇的其他故事。看完感触，是淡定的人生不寂寞，还是淡定的爱情不寂寞？爱情、婚姻确实是人生的一个重要内容，但是可以肯定的说，不是人生的全部。但是这本书，几乎全部是爱情。于是很失望。另外，那些爱情故事，虽然感人至深、催人泪下，却也只是一些普通、庸俗的爱情故事，没有比凤姐看的社会学书籍《知音》里面的爱情故事高雅多少，甚至有一些和街边发的***美容院宣传册中附赠的爱情故事差不多的档次。
读完了，感觉就是标题党，内容和标题不 match。最后，再次忍不住吐毒舌，给了这本书差评。六十耳顺。或许到了六十岁，我才能真正接受、欣赏这些我觉得不好，但是或许只是不符合自己口味的书籍、文章吧。</text>

<summary_trans>Title Party: The text is wrong</summary_trans><text_trans>"The calm life is not lonely," I saw this in the Amazon recommendation list. The three words in the title appeal to me: calm, life, and loneliness. Calmness is the mentality that I have been pursuing and not getting. Life is a question that I have been thinking and can't answer. Lonely, a touch of beauty, a touch of elegance. This book has been in my Amazon collection for a long time, bought a few days ago when I bought the book.
Book to hand, open, read the order, "light is the deepest taste of life." Love, marriage, life, life. Light, but also a taste. It is said that children prefer sweet, heavy food. Young people like to be irritated. As the age grows, the heart slowly fades down, and then there is a mood to experience the plain, taste the plain taste.
The first one, "People are as light as a chrysanthemum", after reading the horror, there is a feeling that the mind is said to be worn. The feeling is that what I want to say in my heart but not said, is said by others, and is said to be so accurate. Or, the thoughts in my heart, ambiguous, unclear, can't express clearly, and the language of others just expresses this idea.
The first article attracted me and continued to read, but it was increasingly disappointing. The whole book consists of a love story, a total of 100 (looks like), or other stories with no more than 5 in it. After reading the feelings, is it a calm life, not lonely, or a calm love is not lonely? Love and marriage are indeed an important part of life, but it is certain that it is not all of life. But this book is almost all love. So very disappointed. In addition, those love stories, although touching and fascinating, are just ordinary and vulgar love stories. There is no more elegant love story in the sociology book "Zhiyin" that Feng Sister sees, and even some are sent to the street. *** The love story in the beauty salon brochure is almost the same grade.
After reading it, I feel that it is the title party, and the content and title are not matched. Finally, I couldn't help but spit the tongue again and gave the book a bad review. Sixty ears are smooth. Maybe at the age of sixty, I can really accept and appreciate these things that I don't think are good, but maybe they are just books and articles that don't suit my taste.</text_trans></item>

看完这本书后，再看新闻，有豁然开朗的感觉，终于知道那些砖家在争论什么了。是的，我们必须知道关键问题在哪里，才知道讨论的方向在哪里。
总的来说，重点在于它选择了众多声音中，一种恰当的改革声音，代表一定立场，我喜欢这个立场。</text>

The Chinese issue is intricate. If you want to understand the national conditions, but you don't have enough experience to read the newspapers and read online articles, you can learn through a book systematically and clarify the context.
After reading this book, I read the news again, and I suddenly felt that I was arguing about what the bricks were arguing about. Yes, we must know where the key issues are and know where the direction of the discussion is.
In general, the point is that it chooses a lot of voices, an appropriate reform voice, and stands for a certain position. I like this position.</text_trans></item>

<summary>答题要点与雅思真题不符</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>本来看着这本书的阅读系列很好，因此也顺带买了一本听力。谁知道，这本听力的书，封面印的说有多么的厉害，里面几乎都用澳大利亚和美国口音的人来念，偶尔会出现英国口音，而且每套题里面的SECTION难度都不一样，从容易到难，比如从SECTION 3开始就乱了，一些复杂的人名就用浓重的老人口音说一遍，比如Herbert Hewitt，里面的解析说这个名字很平常，但一般雅思里面都会有拼读出来。
而且每段文章都会出现很多废话很刻意的去扰乱视听，然后到答案那里就故意很快而且不重复，有一篇是全部题都答完了，那个录音还在讲了好久才停，但是这最后讲的根本跟答题一点都没有关系。
每个答案抓住答点都是不同的，比如有一题问STORE叫什么名字，文章中出现的是提问者问：which store and which branch?回答人说是Electric Life appliance store，然后那人问了是The City Centre Branch吗？回答说是的。然后要填空的问题是：Name of the Store，结果这个空居然填的事故City Centre Branch而非Electric Life。人家明明就在文中已经很清楚的问which store and which branch， 那答案就是Electric Life appliance store的The City Centre Branch。如果要填空的地方是Store，那就应该填Electric Life，如果要填空的地方是Branch，那就应该是The City Centre Branch。但是这本书问的是Store，却要人家回答的是Branch,这出题的人到底有没搞清楚雅思的标准啊？
建议大家不要买这书，混淆大家的判断标准，还是另选其他书吧。但是这个系列的阅读就非常的好，听力真的不行啦说真的！</text>

<summary_trans>The answer to the question does not match the IELTS question.</summary_trans><text_trans>The reading series that originally looked at this book was very good, so I also bought a hearing. Who knows, this book of listening, the cover printed is so powerful, almost all of them are read with Australian and American accents, occasionally a British accent, and the SECTION difficulty in each set of questions is different, from It's easy to get it, for example, it's messed up from SECTION 3. Some complicated names are spoken by a strong old population voice, such as Herbert Hewitt. The analysis inside says that the name is very common, but in general, there will be spells out in IELTS.
And every article will have a lot of nonsense, deliberately disturbing the audio-visual, and then to the answer there will be deliberately fast and not repeated, there is an article is all answered, the recording is still a long time to stop, but this last talk The root of the question has nothing to do with the answer.
Each answer grabs the answer point is different, for example, there is a question asking STORE what name, the article appears in the question asks: which store and which branch? The answerer said it is Electric Life appliance store, then the person asked Is The City Centre Branch? The answer is yes. Then the question to fill in the blanks is: Name of the Store, which results in the empty accident of City Centre Branch instead of Electric Life. It is clear that the store and which branch are very clear in the text, and the answer is The City Centre Branch of the Electric Life appliance store. If the place to fill in the blank is Store, you should fill in Electric Life. If the place to fill in the blank is Branch, it should be The City Centre Branch. But this book asks for Store, but people want to answer the question of Branch. Does the person who made the question have clarified the standard of IELTS?
I suggest that you do not buy this book, confuse everyone's judgment criteria, or choose another book. But this series of reading is very good, listening really can't be true!</text_trans></item>

<summary>完全抄袭！</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>我真是不知道这个 刘雪纯 是什么来历！竟然能抄出这种文章来！还能出书！这个书的内容翻开来一看！完全跟我几年前买的《女人二十几岁决定你的一生》是一摸一样的。完全抄袭不说，内容几乎编排是一样，同样以介绍别人的故事来写书，只不过把故事的人名换了！
我是看了卓越的很多买家推荐才买的！结果竟然是这样一本书。令人大失所望！
这样的内容资料如果可以称作“心计”，那我真是佩服作家你的心机！
总之类似这种“卧槽泥马”的典故实在太多太多！这有让我发现一个！请不要再抄袭了！现在只要是会上网搜索的人都可以当作家吗？？？随便在网上粘贴点文字就可以出书发表！真是NB坏了！
翻开书看第一页就给我恶心坏了！天，怎么会有如此相似的文字，再找出那本《女人二十几岁决定你的一生》。真是不知道两者谁抄袭谁！
但是还是建议大家不要买了！这本书没什么实质内容，套套理论，全是没用的东西。哎！</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Completely plagiarized!</summary_trans><text_trans>I really don't know what Liu Xuechun is from! I can copy this article! Can also publish books! The contents of this book are opened to see! It’s exactly the same as the “Women’s Twenty-Years Determine Your Life” that I bought a few years ago. Completely plagiarized, the content is almost the same, and the same is to introduce the story of others to write a book, but the name of the story has been changed!
I bought it after I saw many excellent buyers! The result turned out to be such a book. It’s disappointing!
If such content material can be called "heart plan", then I really admire the writer's heart!
In short, there are too many allusions like this "slotted mud horse"! This has made me discover one! Please don't plagiarize again! Now anyone who can search online can be a writer? ? ? Just paste the text on the Internet and you can publish the book! Really NB is broken!
Opening the book to see the first page will give me disgusting! God, how can there be such a similar text, and then find out the "Woman in his twenties to decide your life." I really don't know who copied them!
But still recommend that you do not buy it! This book has no substance, and the theory of sleeves is all useless. Hey!</text_trans></item>

<summary_trans>This is a garbage</summary_trans><text_trans>After reading this book, I doubt the level of excellence. The author's academic study is rather rigorous, lacking at least a minimum of textual evidence, and the historical chaos is too numerous to enumerate. To give a simple example, the one who was bribed by Feng Yuxiang was Cao Yu instead of Wu Peifu mentioned in the article! There are so many common sense mistakes. I don't want to comment. Considering that such garbage can't be plundered by our hard-earned banknotes with lower purchasing power, I have to bear a few words. At the same time, I would like to see friends who love to read books, buy books, or look at the brand.</text_trans></item>

<text>看了卓越n多人的好评买了这本书，就如同一个评论者所说，内容空洞，没有任何实际意义的画册，一颗星是给数的纸质的，不知道是现在的白领都脑子白痴了，还是书托太多了，这样的垃圾也被奉为经典，脑袋给门夹了还是怎么的。不过如何，我已经被忽悠买了，郁闷啊。
我仔细研究了一下五星好评的人，发现都是在2010年1月到3月份集中发表的，有的集中在3月2号，后来我们真正顾客买的了的评价都是3月份之后，基本都是1星的，觉得被作者和卓越给忽悠了，特别气愤真是太无耻了，另外为什么我们的评论不能显示为最有用的评论，而托的就可以，要怎么处理才能让更多的人看到真正的评论呢。苍天啊</text>

I carefully studied the five-star praises and found that they were all published in January-March 2010. Some of them were concentrated on March 2nd. Later, the evaluations that our real customers bought were all after March. They are all 1 star. I feel that I am being fooled by the author and the excellence. It is really shameless to be especially angry. In addition, why our comments can not be displayed as the most useful comments, and what can be done, how can we handle more people?

<summary>命运，其实是一种生活的运行规则</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这是一本教导我们关于因果规律的书~也就是关于生活的最基础的规则~和宿命不同，“命运”其实是一种规则，其中的数据是可以由我们自主投放的，只有运算规则是固定的~我得说，“因果律”是真实可靠的，并且也不像“种瓜得瓜种豆得豆”的表面意思那样简单——因果是种很深奥、很深层的规律——这个“深层”是相对于那些会有“例外”的浅层规律而言的~~关于如何应用“因果律”，在后一部《业力管理》中写的就很准确了^_^~~推荐两本一起阅读~~</text>

<summary_trans>Destiny is actually a running rule of life.</summary_trans><text_trans>This is a book that teaches us about the law of causality—that is, the most basic rule about life. Unlike fate, “destiny” is actually a rule in which the data can be independently placed by us. Only the rules of operation are Fixed ~ I have to say that the "causal law" is true and reliable, and it is not as simple as the superficial meaning of "planting melons to make beans and beans" - causality is a very deep and deep law - this " "Deep" is relative to those shallow rules that have "exceptions"~~How to apply "causal law", written in the latter "karma management" is very accurate ^_^~~ Recommend two Read this together~~</text_trans></item>

It was originally directed at the original. If you want to buy it, how can you collect it? ! ! ! There is no desire to even look at it.

<summary>读《瓦尔登湖》应选最佳译本</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>《瓦尔登湖》的最佳译本是著名翻译家徐迟先生的译本（上海译文出版社出版），这可能是译界的公认。徐迟先生是作家，擅长写风景，他的译本在整体上更为传神。可是其他人的译本也一定有各自的长处，至于说徐迟译本中出现的语言瑕疵、翻译修辞上的不足等等，当然可以商榷，但不代表别的版本就没有另外的疏漏。法国文学翻译家柳鸣九先生就感慨，翻译真是一件费力不讨好的事情。的确，翻译作为一种新的语言的再创作，一定有见仁见智的争鸣。我们只能说，某些外国作品有公认的好译本，而不存在绝对的完美译本。如法国文学著作首推傅雷先生的翻译，南京大学许钧教授的译本也很不错。至于不同译本中存在的问题，那是既要指出也需要包容的。如果读者有能力读原著，岂不更好？</text>

<summary_trans>Reading Walden Lake should choose the best translation</summary_trans><text_trans>The best translation of Walden is a translation of the famous translator, Mr. Xu Chi (published by Shanghai Translation Publishing House), which may be recognized by the translation community. Mr. Xu Chi is a writer who is good at writing landscapes. His translation is more expressive on the whole. However, other people's translations must have their own strengths. As for the language 瑕疵 in the translation of Xu Chi, the lack of translation rhetoric, etc., of course, can be discussed, but does not mean that there are no other omissions in other versions. The French literary translator, Mr. Liu Mingjiu, said that the translation was really a thankless thing. Indeed, as a new language, the re-creation of translation must have a contending arrogance. We can only say that certain foreign works have well-recognized good translations, and there is no absolute perfect translation. For example, the translation of Mr. Fu Lei from the French literature works, the translation of Professor Xu Wei from Nanjing University is also very good. As for the problems in different translations, it is both pointed out and inclusive. If the reader has the ability to read the original, isn’t it better?</text_trans></item>

This time I saw the book on Amazon, I was so excited! Just booked. I am an old customer of Amazon. In recent years, I have mainly ordered various books through Amazon.
Less nonsense, the book was delivered, as always, the Amazon style. satisfaction!
After reading it, I started reading. Two days and two nights, I was completely refreshed!
It is recommended that the Lord of the Rings buy it! This book is superior in both translation quality and decoration quality!

<summary>有用，新奇</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>本书专注于讨论混沌，这是个对普通大众比较陌生的概念，但已成为科学的一大分支，虽语言有点专业化，不像小说那样扣人心弦，但仔细理解的话，还是能找到惊喜与收获的，对生命，衰老和死亡有了新的很深的认识和感慨，深切体会到生命的无常和脆弱，更多的是对生命的惊叹和折服。混沌是新兴的领域，有很多颠覆常规常识的观念，即使是粗略的了解，都能对世界观产生大影响，比《读者》之类的杂志更有权威性和说服力。我个人认为，多了解些科学知识，比如这本书讨论的生物学和哲学，还是对性格，眼界，气质，甚至人生目标大有裨益的。仁者见仁智者见智，对科学，哲学感兴趣的就买吧，印刷可以，没有破损。想要有更高的见识和洞见，是要去读一些专业，深奥一点的理论的。熬尽了阅读之苦，就能尝到果实之甜了。</text>

<summary_trans>Useful, novelty</summary_trans><text_trans>This book focuses on chaos, which is a stranger to the general public, but has become a branch of science. Although the language is a bit specialized, it is not as exciting as a novel, but if you understand it carefully, you can still find surprises and gains. I have a new and deep understanding and feeling for life, aging and death. I deeply understand the impermanence and fragility of life, and more are the amazement and implication of life. Chaos is an emerging field. There are many concepts that subvert conventional wisdom. Even a rough understanding can have a big impact on the world view. It is more authoritative and persuasive than magazines such as Reader. I personally think that learning more about scientific knowledge, such as the biology and philosophy discussed in this book, is also beneficial to personality, vision, temperament, and even life goals. The benevolent sees the wise and sees the wisdom, buys it interested in science and philosophy, and prints it without damage. Want to have a higher level of insight and insight, is to read some professional, esoteric theory. After reading the pain of reading, you can taste the sweetness of the fruit.</text_trans></item>

<summary>这套书不错</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>这套书满分100分，我给它90分。喜欢看书的朋友可以买入了。理由如下：
这套书一共四本，每一册300多页，应该说300页的书拿在手中比较舒适。躺着，坐着，坐在小板凳上，倚在沙发上，站着阅读都是可以的。现在许多书都成了大厚书。上海文艺出版社这一点真是为了读者着想。
这套书的开本是635*965，16K，它呈瘦长型，它没有普通16K宽，它的长比32K长。这样的话，每一行的字数就不会很多。如是16K，每行字太多，很容易看串行。每行30字，与普通32K（28字）相当，阅读时非常惬意。
这套书的用纸与用墨。用纸是普通纸，墨还是不错的，整个印刷都非常清晰，没有重影，墨色不匀的现象。
校订认真。目前我只看了两本，还没有发现错误。本书以宋体字为主，还有黑体字，原作者的法文本书以楷体字表现，书中人物的信与日记以仿宋字呈现。个别词语在页的下面有注。为了充分表现原作者的意图，这套书还用了括号，字下加点，看得出，这书的排版是下了功夫的。我们可以信赖上海文艺出版社的书。曾买过一套16卷一套的《话说中国》，很好，对得起大出版社这个称号。
这套书的寿命我定为50年，如果用纸再高档一点，带一些插图，它的寿命将是500年。</text>

<summary_trans>This set of books is good</summary_trans><text_trans>This set of books is worth 100 points, I give it 90 points. Friends who like to read books can buy. The reasons are as follows:
There are four books in this book, each with more than 300 pages. It should be said that a 300-page book is more comfortable in the hand. Lying down, sitting, sitting on a small bench, leaning on the sofa, standing and reading is all right. Many books have now become big books. Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House is really for the reader.
The book is based on 635*965, 16K, which is slim and long. It is not as wide as 16K wide, and its length is longer than 32K. In this case, the number of words in each line will not be much. If it is 16K, there are too many words per line, it is easy to see serial. Each line is 30 words, which is equivalent to ordinary 32K (28 words). It is very pleasant to read.
The paper and ink used in this set of books. The paper is plain paper, the ink is still good, the whole printing is very clear, there is no ghosting, and the ink color is uneven.
The school is serious. I have only read two books at the moment and have not found any errors. The book is mainly composed of the Song Dynasty characters, as well as the bold characters. The French book of the original author is expressed in italics. The letters and diaries of the characters in the book are presented in imitation Song. Individual words are noted below the page. In order to fully express the original author's intentions, the book also uses parentheses, and the words are added. It can be seen that the typesetting of this book is a work of effort. We can rely on the book of Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House. I have bought a set of 16 volumes of "Talking about China", which is very good and worthy of the title of big publishing house.
The life of this set of books is set to 50 years. If the paper is more upscale, with some illustrations, its life expectancy will be 500 years.</text_trans></item>

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>她写以古代为背景的小说还不错，但是她的现代文实在没什么高明的地方，无论是文字还是内容，都不过芸芸众生罢了，在网上读一读还凑合，花钱就不值得了。
情节设置也给人黔驴技穷的感觉，还是老一套：人人都爱的女主角却总觉得大家都是欠她的，然后一个炮灰男被不知疲倦的虐待着。看过桐华别的书的读者，一定明白我是什么意思。
而且，不能理解桐华为什么要把青春写得这么压抑，非悲伤，非痛苦，非迷茫，甚至也谈不上残酷，就是压抑，灰蒙蒙的，透不过气。当然，大家对青春各有所见，但我完全不认为青春应该是这副模样，而且也讨厌这种文章。</text>

No matter whether it is text or content, it is nothing but the sentient beings. It is not worthwhile to read it online.
The plot setting also gives people the feeling of being poor, or the old one: the heroine that everyone loves always feels that everyone owes her, and then a cannon gray man is indifferently abused. Readers who have read Tonghua’s other books must understand what I mean.
Moreover, it is impossible to understand why Tonghua writes his youth so depressed, not sad, not painful, not confused, or even cruel, or oppressive, gray, and suffocating. Of course, everyone has a different opinion about youth, but I don't think that youth should be this appearance, and I hate this kind of article.</text_trans></item>

<summary>不值得买，千万别买！</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>也许是为了节约成本，卖个低价钱，这套书中的每一本用短短的几页纸讲述一个经典的儿童故事。儿童故事原本很经典，但被严重删减，图画、情节和语言索然无味，非常坏胃口。我通常不发表书评，但想到这样的童书拿给孩子读，实在浪费时间，也打击孩子的阅读兴趣，因此特意上来重点评论！</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Not worth buying, don't buy it!</summary_trans><text_trans>Perhaps to save costs and sell for a low price, each of the books tells a classic story of children in just a few pages. The children's story was originally classic, but it was severely cut, and the pictures, plots and language were uninteresting and very bad. I usually don't publish book reviews, but thinking of such a children's book for children to read, it is a waste of time, but also to combat children's reading interest, so deliberately focus on comments!</text_trans></item>

<summary>十年了，今何在没有进步</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>十年前看得《悟空传》，也因此才买了《西游日记》。不图别的，只为看看今何在这十年的人生有没有什么改变，又能给自己带来什么启发或者感悟。事实是，由书来看这十年来他没有改变，或者说没有进步吧。各种语言乱七八糟的堆叠，也不再让人活泼有趣，反而有些反感了。如果真的喜欢人生、个人、抗争、自我、自由、爱这类主题，不如看看毛姆，卡尔维诺，保罗科埃略等等。
这书也就适合18-22岁的娃娃们看看</text>

<summary_trans>Ten years, now there is no progress</summary_trans><text_trans>Ten years ago, I saw "Wu Chuan Biography", and I bought the "Journey to the West". Don't show anything else, just to see if there is any change in the life of this decade, and what kind of inspiration or sentiment can be brought to yourself. The truth is, from the book, he has not changed in the past ten years, or has not made progress. The messy stacking of various languages ​​is no longer lively and interesting, but rather offensive. If you really like the theme of life, personal, resistance, self, freedom, love, look at Maugham, Calvino, Paul Coelho and so on.
This book is also suitable for 18-22 year old dolls to see</text_trans></item>

<summary>《山居笔记》：闲淡中蕴含的丰富文化内涵</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>　　又看了一遍余秋雨先生的《山居笔记》，合书沉思，韵味无穷。书中作者笔调悠闲自在，“历史”在作者笔端流畅，宛如行云流水，文字既冷静又带点感性，历史、地理、人文、文学合而为一，读来引人入胜。第一次阅读《山居笔记》，受到很大的震撼，因为他不同于那种精巧灵活之作，不同于那种市场炒作的主题，他总能以闲话家常的口吻细细的品味，慢慢咀嚼一个历史人、事、物，让读者能够充分感受到其真正的意义，而不需要凭空想象，也不觉枯燥乏味。余秋雨先生的散文是一种典型的文化散文。
　　文章内容以山水为路，人物为线。而最主要的重点是“人”。如作者所说的：“我特别想去的地方，总是古代文化和文人留下较深脚印的所在，说明我心底的山水并不完全是自然山水而是一种人文山水”。从一个王朝的背影到历史的暗角，探讨的是皇帝、文人、小人在历史中所演的角色都以人为中心。而作者将苏东坡、嵇康等等写得活灵活现，他常从主角的内心世界切入，带领我们遨游当代历史，这让我在看文章时，那些往日只存在历史读物中出现的人们仿佛都活了起来和我作时空交流。
　　除了以人为主题外，另一特色是，作者以精密细腻的观察以及感受，总能挖掘出一些我们所不能察觉的事和独具慧眼看穿一件事情的所有真相，而不是像我们一味被历史书籍牵着鼻子走，毫无自己的想法。例如他将原本冷冰冰、凄惨而荒凉的古宁塔中写出真挚而温暖的友情；在看似荒诞不羁的嵇康身上找出他多情可爱的一面；又在富丽堂皇的避暑山庄中看见了一个王朝的没落与矛盾，从东坡的豁达笑声中听出感伤……这让我学到我们在思考时应该是立体的，不能凡事只看表面的假象，应该训练自己能有独特的思考模式和犀利的眼光。而以往根深蒂固的历史观念顿时都已变成了他人的历史解释或是带有民族仇恨、不客观等。
　　《山居笔记》所有散文中，“流放者的土地”让我印象最深。流放无疑是一种对文化的摧残，但他也创造了另一种文化。想像着东北曾背负着流放者那份在心里的高贵和不屈，孕育过流放的下一代。伟大的流放者他们用温热的身躯使这块荒凉的东北美了起来，将它带进了文化的史册。那种感受实在很难在地理书籍上读到。北大荒已不再是北大荒，流放者也不是流放者，时间延续将这段往事带走，但流放者的精神及其意志带不走，因为它已生根，和东北这块土地化为一体。
　　作者的文字魅力，除了为旅游文学展现出另一种文学风格，他借山水风物与历史精魂默默对话，以及人文对土地的洗礼、反叛、发酵上，供读者有反思、幻想的空间和思古之幽情。</text>

<summary_trans>"Mountain Notes": the rich cultural connotation contained in the leisure</summary_trans><text_trans>I also read Mr. Yu Qiuyu’s "Mountain Notes", and the book is contemplative, and the charm is endless. In the book, the author's strokes are laid-back, and “history” is smooth in the author's pen. It is like a flowing stream of words. The words are both calm and sensuous. History, geography, humanities, and literature are one and the same, and they are fascinating. The first time I read "Mountain Notes", I was greatly shocked. Because he is different from the kind of ingenious and flexible work, unlike the theme of market speculation, he can always taste in a gossip, and slowly Chewing a historical person, thing, and thing, so that the reader can fully feel its true meaning, without the need to imagine, or boring. Mr. Yu Qiuyu's prose is a typical cultural prose.
The content of the article is based on mountains and rivers, and the characters are lines. The main focus is on "people." As the author puts it: "The place I especially want to go is always where the ancient culture and the literati left deeper footprints, indicating that the landscape in my heart is not entirely a natural landscape but a human landscape." From the back of a dynasty to the vignetting of history, it is the role of emperors, literati, and villains in history that are human-centered. The author wrote Su Dongpo, Ji Kang and so on. He often cuts in from the inner world of the protagonist and leads us to travel to contemporary history. This makes me look at the articles, and those who have only existed in historical books in the past seem to be alive. Get up and communicate with me in time and space.
In addition to the human-themed theme, another feature is that the author can dig out all the truths that we can't detect and see through one thing with precise and delicate observations and feelings, instead of being blinded by history. The book is holding the nose and has no idea of ​​it. For example, he wrote a sincere and warm friendship in the cold, bleak and desolate Guning Tower; found his affectionate and lovely side in the seemingly absurd Ji Kang; and saw one in the magnificent summer resort The decline and contradiction of the dynasty, I heard sentimentality from the open-minded laughter of Dongpo... This made me learn that we should be three-dimensional when thinking, we should not only look at the illusion of the surface, we should train ourselves to have a unique mode of thinking. And sharp eyes. In the past, the deep-rooted historical concepts have suddenly become the historical interpretation of others or have national hatred and no objectivity.
Among all the essays in "Mountain Notes", "the land of exiles" impressed me the most. Exile is undoubtedly a devastating culture, but he also created another culture. Imagine the noble and unyielding in the heart of the northeast who had been exiled, and gave birth to the next generation of exile. The great exiles used the warm body to make this desolate northeast beautiful and bring it into the annals of culture. That feeling is hard to read on geography books. The Great Northern Wilderness is no longer the Great Northern Wilderness, and the exiles are not exiles. The continuation of the time has taken this past, but the spirit of the exile and its will cannot take away because it has taken root and integrated with the land of the Northeast. .
The author's character charm, in addition to showing another literary style for tourism literature, he uses the landscape and the historical spirit to talk silently, and the human body baptism, rebellion, fermentation on the land, for readers to have reflection, fantasy space and thinking ancient exquisite feelings.</text_trans></item>

  "Your funeral hopes that people will evaluate you. This is your most real wish." It is shocking.
  In addition, what is deeply impressed is that the things to be done are divided into four categories: important and urgent, important but not urgent, unimportant but urgent, unimportant and urgent, list and schedule time. I didn't think so before.

以下是对亚马逊关于促销概念的评说，与此书无关，本以为买满100减20的活动是真的给顾客的优惠，但是过几天来看，居然从11元降到9.2元，仅一本收就有1.8元的价格差，我只是举一个小小的例子！可以想想，所谓的减20元全是谎言，是诱骗消费者上者！而且退书的时候所谓的享受的折扣都还要折回去，同志们啊，下次在买东西时一定擦亮双眼啊！反正我对亚马逊的这种做法表示极度的失望！而且以后也会考虑购买的次数和金额的！做人太不地道了！</text>

The following is a commentary on Amazon's promotion concept. It has nothing to do with this book. I thought that the event of buying 100 minus 20 is really a discount to customers, but in a few days, it actually dropped from 11 yuan to 9.2 yuan. The income has a price difference of 1.8 yuan, I just give a small example! Think about it, the so-called minus 20 yuan is a lie, is to trick consumers into the top! And when the book is returned, the so-called discounts for enjoyment will be folded back. Comrades, the next time you buy something, you must polish your eyes! Anyway, I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's approach! And will consider the number and amount of purchases in the future! Being a man is too unreasonable!</text_trans></item>

<text>本书很详细地介绍了美国的几个州的主要旅游景点及推荐的酒店和餐厅。并且每个州也有相应的地图可对州的地理状况有大概的印象。可惜图片甚少。
建议去美国旅游的朋友可搭配介绍某个城市的书籍搭配一起，做行程。
总体，对此书比较满意.</text>

<summary_trans>Satisfying with Forder's</summary_trans><text_trans>This book provides a detailed introduction to the major tourist attractions and recommended hotels and restaurants in several states in the United States. And each state has a corresponding map that gives a general impression of the state of the state. Unfortunately, there are very few pictures.
It is recommended that friends who travel to the United States can match the books of a certain city to make a trip.
Overall, I am satisfied with this book.</text_trans></item>

<summary>故事好，翻译好，但是出版社做得不好</summary>
<polarity>P</polarity>
<text>墨色不均匀，刚开始看的上的前几十页字非常浅，本来正文、下面的页码和侧边的书名选的字体已经有些过细，再加上这个墨色，我的眼睛都看疼了。好在几十页之后情况好一点，但是也经常能看到几行字中间就有深浅的。难道印刷厂印到这本的时候没墨了么？
以后还想凑全卷的，这样让我怎么放心买……
故事本身没得说，多年的忠实粉丝，如果有超五星我也会毫不犹豫打出来，现在这个四星就扣在书本身的质量上了。</text>

<summary_trans>The story is good, the translation is good, but the publisher is not doing well.</summary_trans><text_trans>The ink color is not uniform. The first few pages of the text that I just started watching are very shallow. The original text, the page number below, and the font name on the side of the book have been too thin. With this ink color, my eyes are hurting. . Fortunately, after a few dozen pages, the situation is better, but it is often seen that there are shades in the middle of a few lines. Didn't the printing company print this book without ink?
I want to make a full roll later, so that I can buy it with confidence...
The story itself has nothing to say, many years of loyal fans, if there are super five stars I will not hesitate to play out, now the four stars are deducted in the quality of the book itself.</text_trans></item>

<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>我连书都没买，就看出错误了！
（1）《暗红色研究》应为《血字的研究》；
（2）《四个人的签名》应为《四签名》，根本不是四个人，而是凶杀后凶手写了“四签名”三个字；
（3）《福尔摩斯退场记》应为《最后一案》或《最后致意》；
  这还是几个错误，其实多着呢！不想挑了。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Error correction</summary_trans><text_trans>I didn't even buy the book, I saw the mistake!
(1) "Dark Red Research" should be "The Study of Blood Words";
(2) "The signature of four people" should be "four signatures", not four people at all, but the words "four signatures" handwritten after the murder;
(3) "Sherlock Holmes Departure" should be "The Last Case" or "The Last Chance";
  This is still a few mistakes, in fact, there are many! I don't want to pick it up.</text_trans></item>

<text>本来昨天就能收到货的，结果送错地方了。今天中午拿到手，拆开后发现封面有条很大的折痕（这个折痕应该是印刷时留下的），是否是正版我也说不好，盗版的可能性更大吧。我感觉喔再看几次，前几页那个彩色插图就要掉了，我第一次打开就那样了，还有书背面那个滴水消失防伪在滴了滴水的情况下还是原来那样，这个让我很怀疑，我来亚马逊买书本来就是看重亚马逊的东西是正品，质量好，结果呢。。。是否是正品我也不好评价了，就是这次购物让我有点不爽，下次买东西我必须多比较几个购物平台了！亚马逊不再是我买书的第一选择了。</text>
<category>book</category>
<summary_trans>Disappointed</summary_trans><text_trans>I was able to receive the goods yesterday, and the result was sent to the wrong place. I got my hand at noon today. After unpacking, I found that the cover had a big crease (this crease should be left when printing). If it is genuine, I can't say it well. The possibility of piracy is even greater. I feel that I have watched it a few times. The color illustrations on the first few pages are about to fall. I opened it the first time, and the drip on the back of the book disappeared. The anti-counterfeiting was still the same in the case of dripping water. This made me I doubt that when I came to Amazon to buy books, I valued Amazon's things as authentic, good quality, and the result. . . Whether it is genuine or not, I am not good at evaluating it. This shopping makes me a bit uncomfortable. I have to compare several shopping platforms next time I buy something! Amazon is no longer the first choice for me to buy a book.</text_trans></item>

I haven't seen anything yet; the only thing I laughed at is that the only book I sent was the same as the one I wanted to change, and it was folds and indentations. I would like to ask if there is any difference between this and no change! Excellence doesn't want to be sincere, even if you don't have to look like it, who do you want to see? ! No longer have any expectations for excellence! It turns out that you are such after-sales service! ! ! Never again will not be able to patronize this black shop that deceives consumers! ! !

But fortunately, let me see two things: First, the excellent book, there is not a book that is completely new, and all the books and scripts that are not sold from the bottom of the box are not sold; The outstanding so-called serious and responsible staff, there is no such thing as a corpse meal!

<summary>可惜内容的质量跟纸张一样</summary>
<polarity>N</polarity>
<text>纸质是环保纸，手感味道颜色跟优质草纸没什么两样。不过重量控制的跟劣质草纸差不多，这点蛮好的！
我敢说这书里面80%的题目解释都很牵强，几乎都是把前面介绍的方法ctrl+c和ctrl+v一下然后下面就blabla说某某选项不对某某对，有些一点道理都没。不过不能否认，有些题目出的还是不错的，比如我就很喜欢Drill #2的第一篇阅读。
我已经做完这本书蛮久了，但茫茫可笑的错误中我记忆犹新的是本书作者甚至连notorious是贬义词都搞不清楚，以及将indifferent与impartial划等号等等等等。。。。不过我们也不能难为印度籍的编辑- -
最后，我们还能对一本将新G作文issue说成"You are given two prompts for the Issue essay, and you must choose one."的号称专业辅导书处期望什么？我相信这句话是本书编辑为了证明他们的新书与他们纸张一样是环保回收的而故意留下的。看着封面上那女人松散的握笔姿势就知道这本书同时也回收了一些别的东西。
在我看来其他人说什么“不错的书”等等的评论跟不评论没什么两样，似乎他们本人都没完全看完本书，却在这里评头论足。。暂且不谈题目的风格，毕竟有些人心目中练枪的唯一方式就是拉个活人过来打，我也不能强求他们改变观念，我是觉得出题风格是次要的，关键是找到自己把握全文的方式，做到无懈可击
相比较而言，Kaplan的书出的就严谨很多，题目解释也细心很多，还有，我喜欢Kaplan的书香味。。特别是闻过太久的草纸之后</text>

<text>这套书是在听司法考试讲座时候，淳于文老师介绍的。考完之后就买了一套，目前正在阅读，看过之后对美国上层建筑有了解，不能说是多深入的了解，但已经有个一个比较感性的认识。跟印象中的美国有很大差距。作者身临其境的写作，更多的是从一个中国人的角度出发，我打算把林达的书都买了看看。</text>

<summary_trans>Very personal author</summary_trans><text_trans>This set of books was introduced during the lectures on judicial examinations. After the test, I bought a set. I am currently reading it. After reading it, I have an understanding of the US superstructure. I can’t say that I have a deeper understanding, but I already have a more perceptual understanding. There is a big gap with the impression of the United States. The author's immersive writing is more from the perspective of a Chinese. I intend to buy Linda's books.</text_trans></item>

过几天又将涨价超过一倍的同一本书放上页面，连我之前发的评论都不知去向了。

I said that I sent an email notification, but I did not receive it. Since it was sent, I will be deflated.
The same is true for another O'Henry novel. The last one was sold, and the original link was deleted the next day.
In a few days, I put the same book that has more than doubled the price on the page, and even the comments I sent before I didn’t know where to go.
Although I am not against the excellent business practices, I still feel awkward.
